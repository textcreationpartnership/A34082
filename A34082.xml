            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>IF I had not peruſed your Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries Book, I ſhould have thought it impoſſible for the moſt implacable Malice to have ſo baſely miſrepreſented the Pious Deſign and Modeſt Expreſſions of your <hi>Friendly Conference.</hi> But now I ſee that <hi>Quakers,</hi> as well as <hi>Jeſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>its,</hi> can make uſe of Equivocation and poſitive <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ntruths, when they diſpute onely to uphold a <hi>Faction.</hi>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:107451:3"/>His mangling your Sentences, and mistaking your Senſe; his forcing of Conſequences from your miſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrued Words, and taking his own wild Suppoſitions for acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Truths; are ſo obvious to an obſerving Reader, that the Man is generally believed to have more of Confidence and crafty Wit, than either of ſolid Learning, or ſincere Honeſty. And though in a Letter of his to a <hi>Quaker</hi> at <hi>York,</hi> he brags that <hi>he hath ſhewed ſome little Learning in this Piece;</hi> I dare affirm, he hath but little to ſhew; being onely happy in this, that he writes to pleaſe an illiterate <hi>Sect.</hi> He may gull his unlearned <hi>Quakers</hi> into the belief that he hath read all thoſe <hi>Fathers</hi> whoſe Names he cites; but the <hi>Prieſts</hi> (whom he reproaches) are wiſe
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:107451:3"/>enough to diſcover, he gleaned his <hi>Quotations</hi> up at the ſecond hand, out of <hi>Fiſher</hi> againſt <hi>Biſhop Gau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,</hi> and ſome other obſcure <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> VVriters: which he hath alſo done with ſo little skill, that when the Printer in <hi>Fiſher</hi> had miſtaken <hi>Fimicus</hi> for <hi>Firmicus,</hi> this poor Retailer calls him <hi>Fimicus</hi> alſo, <hi>pag. 115.</hi> And what he read in the ſame <hi>Fiſher</hi> of one <hi>Baſil,</hi> his groſs ignorance applies to <hi>Baſil the Great,</hi> involving himſelf thereby in the abſurdity of aſſerting this monſtrous and ridiculous untruth, <hi>That</hi> Baſil the Great <hi>refuſed to ſwear at a Council, which was called above threeſcore years af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he was dead,</hi> pag. <hi>165.</hi> But I will not anticipate your diſcoveries of his Ignorance by any more In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, becauſe I doubt not but
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:107451:4"/>you will ſufficiently convince the world, that there is no reaſon why <hi>T. Elwood</hi> ſhould paſs for a Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar among his own Party, but onely becauſe (as himſelf ſaith, <hi>p. 355.</hi>) <hi>Aſinus Aſino, Sus ſui pulcher.</hi> And when you have pulled off his Vizard, his very Friends doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs will begin to bluſh, that they have adored ſo mean a Creature, while he was covered with a Lions skin. And I hope the diſcovery may tend to reduce them to the <hi>Proteſtant Church,</hi> where they will find more ingenuous, more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt, and more able Guides. I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs I once thought the juſteſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to his Ignorance and Malice, his unjuſt Accuſations and notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Falacies, was to anſwer them with ſilence: But when I conſider how eaſily ſo plauſible a Diſcourſe
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:107451:4"/>might ſeduce ſome well-meaning Men out of the right way, or hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en them in the wrong, I judge it neceſſary to lay aſide all conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the meanneſs of the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary; and will not onely encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage you to publiſh the Anſwer which I hear you have prepared againſt this bold Antagonist, but ſhall venture to caſt in my Symbol alſo, upon his <hi>laſt Chapter of Tythes.</hi> Not that I delight to put my Sickle into anothers Harveſt, nor that I eſteem you will need any <hi>Second</hi> againſt ſo eaſie and obnoxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous an Opponent: Your own Skill is ſo great, your Cauſe ſo good, and your fair Advantages againſt this Man are ſo very many; that I make no doubt but you have already pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared a ſolid and judicious Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futation of all his Pretences, as
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:107451:5"/>well in this, as the other <hi>Chapters.</hi> Yet I deem it not unfit to add theſe Papers, for the following Reaſons.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> Becauſe I think this Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of <hi>Tythes</hi> deſerves a fuller and more particular Conſideration, than the brevity of your general Anſwer will allow.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Becauſe the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of this Chapter is <hi>T. E</hi>'s main device to alienate Mens minds from the <hi>Church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and ſo to heighten our unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate Diviſions; wherein there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he ought to be prevented by all juſt means.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The obſtinacy which the unhappy <hi>Quakers</hi> contract from ſuch falſe Inſinuations as theſe of <hi>T. E.</hi> in this Caſe of <hi>Tythes,</hi> expoſes them to more Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings than all their other Errors:
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:107451:5"/>So that in pity to theſe ill-instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted Perſons, I would attempt their full ſatisfaction in this matter.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Laſtly,</hi> I think it not inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient to try whether it be not poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, by variety of Methods and Arguments, for us both to advance the ſame Charitable End, <hi>viz.</hi> to reſcue all miſtaken Diſſenters from their Prejudices againſt ſo pious a Donation, for ſo neceſſary an End.</p>
            <p>Theſe were my <hi>Motives</hi> to this <hi>Undertaking.</hi> And the <hi>Method</hi> by which I have proceeded therein, is this.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> I have deduced the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory of <hi>Tythes</hi> through Three eminent <hi>Periods of Time,</hi> viz. <hi>Before the Law, Under the Law,</hi> and <hi>The Times of the Goſpel:</hi> wherein I have made it evident, That <hi>Tythes</hi> were paid, among
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:107451:6"/>the <hi>Patriarchs</hi> by <hi>Revelation;</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the <hi>Gentiles</hi> by <hi>Tradition,</hi> and the <hi>Light of Nature;</hi> among the <hi>Jews</hi> by a <hi>written Command from God the Father;</hi> among the <hi>Primitive Chriſtians</hi> by the <hi>Eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment of Chriſt and his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles.</hi> I have ſhewed alſo, That the moſt <hi>Ancient Fathers</hi> aſſert them to be Due to <hi>Chriſtian Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters:</hi> That many <hi>Councils</hi> do <hi>ſuppoſe</hi> them, and others <hi>enjoyn</hi> them to be Paid: and, That the <hi>Laws</hi> of divers <hi>Chriſtian Princes</hi> did of old Confirm them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> I have vindicated the <hi>Donations</hi> and <hi>Confirmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> of <hi>Tythes</hi> in <hi>this Kingdom;</hi> proving that the <hi>Donors</hi> of them (our pious <hi>Saxon Anceſtors</hi>) were neither <hi>Papiſts,</hi> nor <hi>Idolaters;</hi> but that they were <hi>Given</hi> long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:107451:6"/>
               <hi>Popery</hi> came in, <hi>Confirmed</hi> by divers <hi>Princes</hi> and <hi>Parliaments</hi> in <hi>every Age,</hi> and <hi>ſecured</hi> by <hi>good Laws</hi> after <hi>Popery</hi> was caſt out: So that they were as <hi>freely and rightly Granted,</hi> as <hi>frequently and fully Confirmed,</hi> and have been as <hi>long</hi> and as <hi>quietly En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed,</hi> as <hi>any Poſſeſſions</hi> in the <hi>whole Nation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> I have conſidered all the <hi>particular Objections</hi> urged by <hi>T. E.</hi> against the <hi>Reaſonable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Lawfulneſs of Tythes;</hi> and have made it appear, that he hath <hi>blaſphemed Almighty God, reviled our Law-givers, pervert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed our Laws, ſlandred the whole Nation,</hi> and <hi>contradicted him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf;</hi> and that he is mistaken in <hi>Scripture, Hiſtory, Matter of Fact,</hi> and <hi>every thing he meddles
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:107451:7"/>with.</hi> So far is he from proving <hi>Tythes</hi> to be <hi>Jewiſh</hi> or <hi>Popiſh, unreaſonable</hi> or <hi>ridiculous,</hi> a <hi>hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible Oppreſſion</hi> or a <hi>foul Abuſe,</hi> as he inſolently brags; that he hath proved nothing but his own <hi>Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and Diſhoneſty.</hi> The ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous conſideration of which Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars, may convince all that are not blinded with wilful prejudice, That <hi>Tythes</hi> are a <hi>pious, juſt,</hi> and <hi>reaſonable Payment,</hi> which were <hi>Religiouſly</hi> ſetled upon, are <hi>Rightfully</hi> to be claimed by, and ought <hi>Conſcienciouſly</hi> to be paid unto the <hi>Miniſters of the Goſpel.</hi> But I will not detain you longer in this <hi>general Account,</hi> nor di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert you from the peruſal of the <hi>Obſervations themſelves,</hi> where <hi>all theſe Things</hi> are more fully made out.</p>

               <p>§. 1. WHEN I firſt caſt my eyes upon <hi>Thomas Elwood</hi>'s Chapter concerning <hi>Tythes,</hi> I could not but take notice, that the Subject did ſo raiſe his Paſſion, that he throws off the uſual Formality of that Patience and Meekneſs which thoſe of his Party generally pretend to, and flies out into ill Language at the entrance into his Diſcourſe upon them: for
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:107451:8"/>he calls them, <q>
                     <hi>The Prieſts Delilah, ;the very Darling and Minion of the Clergy.</hi>
                  </q> Now ſince Railing is not Reaſoning, I will not meddle with his Scurrility, but rather inquire in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Cauſes why he and his Party are ſo bitter againſt <hi>Tythes.</hi> The ruder ſort (it may be) are acted by meer Covetouſneſs, pretending Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience to ſave their Purſes, ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing this kind of Godlineſs is great Gain: But <hi>T.

So that it is evident, you laid aſide this Weapon <hi>(of the Divine Right)</hi> not out of any diſtruſt of the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, nor out of any great Opinion of your Adverſaries Skill; but in very truth, you ſeem to have been
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:107451:11"/>loth to caſt Pearls before Swine, who underſtand not the value of them; and you were hardy enough to have inſiſted on it, if you had been to deal with nobler Antagoniſts.

Yet ſince <hi>T. E.</hi> provokes the <hi>Prieſts</hi> to the taking up
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:107451:11"/>this Argument again, I hope to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate, That they need not be aſhamed of the Weapon, nor afraid of this daring Adverſary.</p>
               <p>§. 3. To make out the <hi>Divine Right</hi> of <hi>Tythes,</hi> there are <hi>three Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ods</hi> to be conſidered:

               </p>
               <p>Concerning the <hi>firſt Period, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Law,</hi> you ſaid very little in your <hi>Conference,</hi> as not deſigning to manage this Argument; onely I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive you had mentioned, <hi>That the Divine Right of Tythes was derived from Melchiſedec, not from Levi.</hi> Which Paſſage being ſingle, and not guarded with any Proofs or Reaſons, this ſculking Adverſary falls upon very fiercely, fancying, if he can run down this one Sentence, which ſtood naked, he ſhall then confute the <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Right of Tythes.</hi> Here (thinks the <hi>Quaker</hi>) is an open place; he is driving at the <hi>Humane Right,</hi> and I find no Arguments to grieve me in
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:107451:12"/>my oppoſing the <hi>Divine Right:</hi> I will therefore triumph over this lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle occaſional touch, and then pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim, I have confuted the <hi>Jus Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinum;</hi> and upon that Suppoſition, I ſhall more eaſily find out an Anſwer to his Arguments <hi>de Jure Humano,</hi> by aſſerting, That all his Humane Laws rely on a falſe Foundation. But if <hi>T. E.</hi> had been a noble Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, he ſhould firſt have diſproved the <hi>Jus Humanum,</hi> which was the Argument you managed; and not from a tranſient Speech have boaſted, he had diſproved clearly the <hi>Divine Right</hi> of <hi>Tythes;</hi> which he is ſo far from being able to confute, that his firſt words do declare, he doth not underſtand the Queſtion: For this <hi>Quaker</hi> thus begins; <hi>It is then in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quirable, Whether or no</hi> Tythes <hi>were ever due to</hi> Melchiſedec? <hi>That which ſhould make them due, muſt be a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand — but we do not find any Command in Scripture that they ſhould be paid to</hi> Melchiſedec. The Aſſertors of the <hi>Divine Right</hi> of
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:107451:12"/>
                  <hi>Tythes</hi> do not make them originally due either to <hi>Melchiſedec,</hi> or <hi>Levi;</hi> but to God himſelf, whoſe Right to them is founded primarily upon the Law of Nature, antecedent to any poſitive Conſtitution: For ſince <hi>the earth is the Lords, and the fulneſs thereof, Pſal.</hi> xxiv. 1. and that all we enjoy is derived from his Bounty and Bleſſing, Natural Reaſon teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth us to give God ſome part of his Gifts back again, as a token of our gratitude; which is but the giving him of his own, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> xxix. 14. And this Natural Law we have tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed into the Scripture: <hi>Honour the Lord with thy ſubſtance, Prov.</hi> iii. 9. which Rule obligeth <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> as well as <hi>Jews.</hi> Some part of our Subſtance being therefore due to God, and <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Jacob</hi> (before any poſitive Law) having by their Examples declared, that the <hi>Tenth</hi> was <hi>that Part;</hi> there was a claim made of this <hi>Tenth part,</hi> as being originally due to God long before. <hi>All the Tythe of the land is

So that we are to inquire, who muſt be Gods Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver; and for that, even Reaſon will teach us, That what is due to the Maſter, ought to be paid to his next and immediate Servants, that is, to
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:107451:13"/>his <hi>Prieſts.</hi> And <hi>Abraham,</hi> in paying his <hi>Tythes</hi> (which were Gods part) unto <hi>Melchiſedec</hi> the <hi>Prieſt of the moſt High God,</hi> did confirm this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctate of Reaſon, That the <hi>Prieſts</hi> ſhould be Gods Receivers: and God himſelf gave more full proof of it in the <hi>Moſaical Law,</hi> when he made ſo plain an Aſſignation of <hi>Tythes</hi> to thoſe who were his Miniſters then; <hi>Behold, I have given the Children of Levi all the Tenth in Iſrael, Numb.</hi> xviii. 21. Yea, the Light of Nature taught the <hi>Gentiles</hi> to beſtow that upon their <hi>Prieſts,</hi> which they had vowed to their Gods: And <hi>Origen</hi> gives us the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> ſenſe of this matter; <hi>That is ſaid to be offered to God</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>which is given to his Prieſts</hi>

We ſee then how <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> might know that part of his Subſtance was due to God, and that <hi>Melchiſedec</hi> was to be the Receiver thereof, without any expreſs written Rule to direct him.

<pb n="24" facs="tcp:107451:14"/>to</hi> Abraham <hi>to pay his Tythes to</hi> Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſedec: For, there was not any Scripture at all in <hi>Abraham</hi>'s time, nor was he directed (as we are) by a written Word, but by the Light of Nature, by the Tradition of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding Patriarchs, by Inſpiration of the Spirit, and ſometimes by ſpecial Revelation. <hi>Moſes</hi> indeed did write a brief Hiſtory of thoſe Times 400 years after: but ſince he compriſes the ſpace of 2300 years in one Book of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> it cannot be expected he ſhould ſet down all Particulars, nor in all the Actions of the Patriarchs ſhew what Reaſon they had for, or how they were directed in ſuch an Action. We know from the Light of Nature, that part of our Subſtance is due to God; and we gather from the Act of <hi>Abraham</hi> (an inſpired Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarch) that the <hi>Tenth</hi> is that part, and the <hi>Prieſt</hi> the Receiver thereof. Yet if any would be ſatisfied how <hi>Abraham</hi> came to know, that the <hi>Tenth part,</hi> and no other, was that which ſhould be given to God, I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:107451:14"/>That in all reaſon we ought to believe it was at firſt revealed by Almighty God to him, or to ſome of the firſt Patriarchs, who were dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted by the Divine Spirit to pitch upon <hi>this Part,</hi> which the Patriarchs are recorded to have fixed upon: For, if it had been a meer Humane Invention, it is unlikely God ſhould have imitated them, in chuſing the <hi>ſame Part:</hi> And by this after-Act the Divine Majeſty did approve that Number, and declare the Patriarchs were at firſt guided by his Spirit in the choyce thereof. And if the <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers</hi> (now that there is a Written Rule) pretend to be guided by the Spirit of God, at leaſt in their So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Actions; how much more ought we to believe, that the holy Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archs were ſo guided, before there was any Written Word to manifeſt Gods Will? Thus the way of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouring God by Oblation of Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, is believed to have been firſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed to <hi>Adam,</hi> although the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Command for it be not record<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.

                     <hi>The</hi> Tyrians <hi>gave the Tenth Part to their Gods: And by their Example the</hi> Carthaginians (<hi>a Colony of</hi> Tyrians) <hi>ſent their Tythes yearly to</hi> Hercules Tyrius; <hi>and finding themſelves unfortunate when they for a while had omitted it, they reſtor'd the Tythes as before</hi>

There are more Proofs of this kind in Sir <hi>Henry Spelman</hi>'s larger Work of <hi>Tythes:</hi> But theſe may ſuffice to ſhew, that the moſt diſtant Nations did conſent in giving this Tenth part to their Gods; which therefore we muſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve they had by Tradition from the firſt Patriarchs, who received it by Revelation from God. This is a ſufficient account by what Authority <hi>Abraham</hi> might proceed in the choyce of the Tenth part: And it is
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:107451:16"/>not neceſſary (ſince the Scripture is ſilent) I ſhould determine, whether <hi>Abraham</hi> was immediately directed to it, or whether he learned it from <hi>Melchiſedec,</hi> (who, St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Tythed Abraham</hi>) or whether they did not both learn it from the firſt Patriarchs, which is moſt likely; it being ſufficient, that God hath Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded it with approbation, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards Ratified it by following this Example. Even as in the Caſe of putting an Adultereſs to death, <hi>Judah</hi> proceeds upon that, as being a juſt Puniſhment: And though we read of no Command before to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act it into a Law, yet we believe <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah</hi> received that Law by Tradition from the Patriarchs, who were taught it by God, <hi>Gen.</hi> xxxviii. 35. And we are the more confirmed this Law came from God at firſt, becauſe he approved it, and writ it down af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards, <hi>Levit.</hi> xx. 10. And when <hi>T.

This was an extraordinary Occaſion, wherein <hi>Abraham</hi> having got a Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory by Gods Bleſſing, did give to God the Tenth of all he had now gotten; as in all probability he was wont ordinarily to do, of all that he got by Gods ordinary Bleſſing; one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly this (as more eſpecially remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able) is recorded in this ſhort Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory. So that <hi>T. E</hi>'s ſaying <hi>he doth not read in</hi> Geneſis <hi>that</hi> Abraham <hi>paid his Tythes conſtantly,</hi> is no Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, unleſs all that <hi>Abraham</hi> or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:107451:17"/>did were recorded there. And I may ask him where he reads there, that <hi>Abraham</hi> did not pay them. His Negative arguing is of no more force, than it would be if he ſhould ſay, Thoſe <hi>Ante-diluvian</hi> Patriarchs did nothing elſe while they lived but beget Sons and Daughters, becauſe no more is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded of many of them, <hi>Gen.</hi> v. <hi>T. E.</hi> therefore cannot prove <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> did not pay <hi>Tythes</hi> ordinarily; and I can make it appear very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable he did: For, firſt, It is very probable <hi>Melchiſedec</hi> was the ſame with <hi>Sem,</hi> the Son of <hi>Noah:</hi> ſo the ancient <hi>Hebrew</hi> Traditions ſaid

Yea, there are ancient Authors, and probable Reaſons to induce us to believe, that <hi>Abraham</hi> was called out from amongſt his Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrous Countrymen, by God, on purpoſe to ſend him into <hi>Canaan,</hi> to be inſtructed by <hi>Melchiſedec</hi> in the Worſhip of the True God.

We cannot be poſitive in a matter of ſo great Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity: but I hope theſe things may ſuffice to make it very probable, that <hi>Melchiſedec</hi> was <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Prieſt in Ordinary. And doubtleſs <hi>Abraham</hi> and he were acquainted before, yea, in League together, as appears from his being ſo glad of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory, preſenting him with Bread and Wine for his Refreſhment, or (as ſome have thought) offering a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of Praiſe to God, in thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs for the ſame. And ſince all <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Increaſe came as much by Gods Bleſſing, as theſe Spoils, why ſhould he not pay <hi>Tythes</hi> of his <hi>ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Gains,</hi> as well as of his <hi>extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary?</hi> And it is very likely <hi>Jacob</hi> had ſeen this Cuſtom in his Fathers Houſe, becauſe he vows to give unto God <hi>the Tenth</hi> of all the Goods that God ſhould give him, even in that ſtrange Land to which he was then going, <hi>Gen.</hi> xxviii. 22.

<pb n="35" facs="tcp:107451:19"/>it will then be time enough for him to ſay, that <hi>Abraham</hi> paid not <hi>Tythes</hi> of any thing but the <hi>Spoils.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 6. Another bolder pretence of <hi>T. E.</hi> is, <hi>pag.</hi> 280. <hi>viz. That Tythes could not be due to Melchiſedec upon a Right founded in Natural Juſtice and Equity, ſince there was not in thoſe days any ſetled Publick Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, wherein he could perform any Prieſtly Office, for which Tythes could be due to him.</hi> This poor <hi>Quaker</hi> is as bold, as he is blind; and hath ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed himſelf to the ſcorn of all knowing Men by this abſurd Poſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which I might confute from that place of <hi>Gen.</hi> iv. 26. <hi>Then began men to call upon the Name of the Lord:</hi> which muſt be meant in publick, for in private they did it before; unleſs <hi>T.

<pb n="36" facs="tcp:107451:20"/>high God? Gen.</hi> xiv. 18. And doth not S. <hi>Paul</hi> make him a Type of <hi>Chriſts</hi> Prieſthood? And had he not a fixed place of Reſidence at <hi>Salem?</hi> Now what is a Prieſt fixed in a City for? Not for private Worſhip, that every man may perform at home: It was then for performing publick Worſhip that he reſided there. And we cannot ſuſpect ſo holy a man as <hi>Melchiſedec</hi> would be negligent in his Office: wherefore we ought to believe, he did perform Gods publick Worſhip ſolemnly at <hi>Salem,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly alſo. And by that he had a Right founded in Natural Juſtice and Equity, to receive <hi>Tythes</hi> from all within his Juriſdiction. It is very likely the <hi>Tyrians,</hi> who were of the ancient <hi>Phoenician</hi> Inhabitants of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan,</hi> learned to pay <hi>Tythes</hi> to their <hi>Prieſts</hi> (which they are obſerved to have done) from the <hi>Tythes</hi> paid to <hi>Melchiſedec,</hi> when he was a <hi>Prieſt</hi> here among the <hi>Phoenicians.</hi> And as to this occaſion, it is apparent, that he did perform the Office of a <hi>Prieſt</hi>
                  <pb n="37" facs="tcp:107451:20"/>now to <hi>Abraham,</hi> in bleſſing the moſt High God for his Victory, with <hi>ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Hymns</hi> (ſaith <hi>Joſephus);</hi> and in bleſſing <hi>Abraham</hi> himſelf at this time: And ſo he deſerved thoſe <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Tythes,</hi> as juſtly as he did his <hi>ordinary Tythes</hi> for his <hi>daily Adminiſtrations.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He proceeds in his groſs miſtakes, ſaying, <hi>ibid. I find not one Inſtance (this ſingle gift of Abrahams except<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) of giving or receiving Tythes, in all that</hi> 400 <hi>years between Abrahams time and the Levitical Prieſthood.</hi> If this were true, that the Scripture did not mention any more Inſtances of paying <hi>Tythes,</hi> it doth not at all prove, they were never paid at other times: For an Argument from Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture-ſilence in matters of Fact is not valid, as we noted before. But alas! this inſpired Mans Reading and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation both fail him in this matter; for there is a plain Inſtance in holy <hi>Jacob, Gen.</hi> xxviii. 22. who made a ſolemn Vow to give unto God <hi>the Tenth</hi> of all his <hi>Gains:</hi> And <hi>Joſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus</hi>

                     <hi>Joſeph. Antiq. li.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 18.</note>, he did perform it. Now if <hi>Jacob</hi> did perform this Vow, then there is another Inſtance of giving <hi>Tythes:</hi> And if <hi>T.

It is true, the Book of <hi>Geneſis</hi> doth not tell us who was Gods Receiver then; but no doubt there were ſome per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed that Office, though it be not expreſſed who. However, if <hi>Jacob</hi> gave them immediately to God by way of Sacrifice (which is all that <hi>T.

               <p>§. 7. He hath yet another fetch more, <hi>pag.</hi> 281. <hi>That if Tythes were due to Melchiſedec, yet could not the Clergie of this Age derive any Right from him to them, inaſmuch as they are not of his Prieſthood.</hi> I hope
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:107451:21"/>
                  <hi>T. E.</hi> will grant, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> was of his Prieſthood; or elſe he contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicts the Scripture, <hi>Pſal.</hi> cx. 4. And if he grant this, we muſt ask, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther or no his Apoſtles were not his Succeſſors? and then, Whether we do not derive our Succeſſion from them? Beſides, <hi>Aaron</hi>'s Prieſthood was onely Temporal; but <hi>Melchiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dec</hi>'s was to continue to the end of the World. And indeed all the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers note, That <hi>Melchiſedec</hi> had the ſame <hi>Prieſthood</hi> with the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of the Goſpel: He was not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived from <hi>Levi,</hi> nor admitted to his Office by the Catalogue of his Parents, (whence he is called, <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out father and mother,</hi> that is, <hi>of ſuch a certain Tribe):</hi> His Worſhip was altogether Spiritual, Praiſing God, Praying for <hi>Abraham;</hi> offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no bloody Sacrifices, but onely bringing forth <hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>Wine,</hi> which ſome have thought to be the Types of the great Goſpel-Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the <hi>Lords Supper.</hi> And hence it is plain, That we are <hi>Prieſts</hi>
                  <pb n="40" facs="tcp:107451:22"/>after <hi>Melchiſedec</hi>'s Order. And if Authority of Fathers be of as much credit, as the ſingle Teſtimony of <hi>T. E.</hi> I can produce the plain words of S. <hi>Hierom,</hi> S. <hi>Chryſoſtom,</hi> S. <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin, Epiphanius, Theophylact,</hi> and many more, affirming, That the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Miniſters of the <hi>Chriſtian Church</hi> are of <hi>Melchiſedec's Prieſthood:</hi> And none (that ever I heard of) before, did deny it, but the <hi>Jews,</hi> and <hi>this Quaker.</hi> But his Aſſertion is not more ſtrange, than his Reaſon is ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous: For if we ask him, why he denies us to be of <hi>Melchiſedec's Prieſthood,</hi> he anſwers, <hi>Every one knows, that theſe men are made Prieſts after the Law of a Carnal Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; whereas Melchiſedec was made a Prieſt after the Law of an endleſs Life.</hi> Doth every one know this? No ſure: for every one knows not the meaning of this Phraſe, [<hi>To be made a Prieſt after the Law of a Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Commandment,</hi> Hebr. vii. 16.] no not this <hi>Quaker</hi> himſelf, who hath learned to cant in this Language;
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:107451:22"/>which if he had known the meaning of, he would not have miſapplied ſo groſly: For the Apoſtle ſpeaking of the <hi>Jewiſh Prieſts</hi> in that place, ſaith, <hi>They were made Prieſts after the Law of a Carnal Commandment;</hi> that is, according to <hi>Moſes</hi> Law, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted of outward and weak Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments, reaching onely to the purifying of the Fleſh. Now what an idle and impertinent man is this, to ſay, we are made Prieſt, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>Moſes</hi> Law, and that every one knows this! O impudent Slander! Are we bound to all the Sacrificings, Waſhings, and other <hi>Levitical</hi> Rites and Ceremonies, at our Ordination? Every one will know by this, that <hi>T. E.</hi> can prattle in <hi>Scripture-phraſe,</hi> without any knowledge of its <hi>mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi> 'Tis evident we are not Prieſts according to that carnal, outward, changeable, <hi>Levitical</hi> Law; but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Law of the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> whoſe Eternal Duties have in them the power of an Endleſs Life. And as this Law muſt never change, ſo
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:107451:23"/>neither muſt our Prieſthood; but, like that of <hi>Melchiſedec,</hi> ſhall endure for ever. And as we bear the ſame Office with him, and do the like Work, we deſerve the ſame Reward, and may expect <hi>Tythes</hi> as well as he. And now whereas the boaſting <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker</hi> ſaith, <hi>He thinks he need not ſtick to ſay, he hath proved Tythes were not due to Melchiſedec;</hi> the ſober Reader will believe his onely Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is, becauſe he will not ſtick to ſay any thing, be it never ſo falſe and unreaſonable.</p>
               <p>§. 8.

                  <pb n="43" facs="tcp:107451:23"/>ſo far miſtake, as to think that the abrogation of the <hi>Levitical Law</hi> concerning <hi>Tythes,</hi> was an abrogati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Tythes</hi> themſelves. Our Lord abrogated the <hi>Levitical Law</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the <hi>Modes of Gods Worſhip;</hi> but he did not abrogate <hi>Gods Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip.</hi> The Worſhip of God was founded upon the <hi>Law of Nature,</hi> and <hi>Divine Revelation;</hi> and was performed by the <hi>Patriarchs</hi> before there was any <hi>written Law</hi> about it. The <hi>Levitical Law</hi> enjoyned many <hi>Modes</hi> and <hi>Circumſtances</hi> proper to <hi>that Diſpenſation,</hi> and relating to <hi>Chriſt to come;</hi> all which fell with that <hi>Polity,</hi> and were abrogated by <hi>Chriſt:</hi> But the main Duty of <hi>Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipping God</hi> continued in force ſtill. Even ſo in the Caſe of <hi>Tythes,</hi> they had not their Foundation upon, nor their Original from the <hi>Levitical Law:</hi> God had a Right to them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; and in his Right <hi>(jure Divino)</hi> they had been paid to his Receiver. The <hi>Law of Nature,</hi> aſſiſted by <hi>parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Inſpiration,</hi> had ſo fully decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:107451:24"/>the <hi>Divine Right of Tythes,</hi> that holy Men had recognized Gods due to them; and the Father of the <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites</hi> had made a ſpecial Vow to pay this <hi>Divine Tribute.</hi> So that there was no need for God to Inſtitute <hi>Tythes</hi> anew; and accordingly he claims them, and ſuppoſes them to be his Due by a Right antecedent to the <hi>Levitical Law, Exod.</hi> xxii. 29. <hi>Levit.</hi> xxvii. 30. And having choſen the <hi>Jews</hi> for his peculiar People, and eſtabliſhed a Polity among them pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to that Diſpenſation; as his Church was confined to that one Nation, ſo his Prieſts were fixed to one Tribe; and on that Tribe he ſettles his own <hi>Demeſnes, Tythes,</hi> by a plain Aſſignation of them to the <hi>Levites,</hi> as his Receivers, <hi>Numb.</hi> xviii. 21. and ſo they were to continue ſo long as that Polity ſtood. Now the reſtraining theſe <hi>Tythes</hi> to the Tribe of <hi>Levi,</hi> and all the Circumſtances of Tything which related to the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial Worſhip, ſuch as the bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>firſt</hi> or <hi>Levites Tythe in ſpecie</hi>

Now when <hi>Chriſt</hi> did abro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate that Miniſtry, theſe Appendixes muſt needs be abrogated with it; but the main Duty (which was ſo before the Ceremonial Law) remains ſtill. The putting on a new Sute, doth not make one a new Man; nor doth the pulling it off again kill him: And there may be many alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations in Circumſtances, the Eſſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als ſtill remaining the ſame.

                  <hi>Divine Right</hi> now? I anſwer, Though we do not claim by it, yet we may learn ſomething from it, to clear that Title which we have from other Laws. For, <hi>Firſt,</hi> This ſhews how God continued his Claim to thoſe <hi>Tythes</hi> which were his due before: And this ſhews his approbation of the Payment of them by the Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archs. This alſo confirms the diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal of them to thoſe that bear the Office of Gods Miniſters, and makes good the Preſcription againſt thoſe who are not Gods Miniſters. <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,</hi> This was a Pattern for <hi>Chriſt</hi> to imitate, in his Proviſion for Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel-Miniſters, as S. <hi>Paul</hi> teacheth us, where he ſaith, <hi>Know ye not, that they which miniſter about holy things, [i. e.</hi> the Levites] <hi>live of the things of the Temple, [i. e</hi> Tythes]? <hi>and they which wait at the Altar, [i. e.</hi> the Jewiſh Prieſts] <hi>are partakers with the Altar [i. e.</hi> in the Sacrifices and Oblations]? <hi>Even ſo hath the Lord ordained, that they which preach the Goſpel ſhould live of the Goſpel,</hi>

                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> The Subſtance of that which was requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red then, is due ſtill; not by vertue of that Law, but becauſe there is an inherent Equity in the thing. And this is <hi>Origen</hi>'s meaning in the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid place, when he ſaith, <q>There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I think it neceſſary that this Law [of Paying Tythes of the Fruits of the Earth] and ſome others, ſhould ſtand in force ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Letter.</q> And ſo we muſt interpret S. <hi>Hierom,</hi> when he ſaith, <q>That which we have ſaid of Tythes and Firſt-fruits, which were once given by the People to the Prieſts and Levites, you muſt underſtand alſo of the Chriſtian People, to whom it is commanded
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:107451:26"/>not onely to give <hi>Tythes,</hi> but to ſell all
<note n="(ſ)" place="margin">
                        <hi>Hieron. in Mal.</hi> 3.</note>:</q> That is, ſo much of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand as was moral, ſo much as was grounded upon Eternal Reaſon, ought to ſtand. God is eternally Lord of the World, and muſt alwaies be worſhipped, and alwaies have Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, and theſe muſt alwaies be maintained out of their Maſters Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. When the <hi>Levitical Prieſthood</hi> failed, there muſt be another and a better; and therefore we may claim <hi>Tythes</hi> as God's Due, and as his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters Portion, (as they were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared to be both before the <hi>Leviti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Law,</hi> and under it,) and yet need not claim them by the <hi>Levitical Law,</hi> as it is Ceremonial.</p>
               <p>And now I hope <hi>T. E.</hi> muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, that your ſecond Poſition, <hi>viz. [That Tythes are not purely Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial]</hi> is made good alſo; ſince I have ſhewed they were grounded on the Law of Nature, and Primitive Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation, relying on an Internal Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctitude in the thing it ſelf, and an Eternal Reaſon of it; and were paid
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:107451:27"/>by thoſe Patriarchs who lived long before the Ceremonial Law, by vertue of the preceding Declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the <hi>Divine Right</hi> unto them. Tis true, all things done by the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarchs were not Eternal Duties, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe all things they did relyed not on theſe Principles, which the Pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Thythes</hi> rely upon. <hi>Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion</hi> was not grounded on the Law of Nature, nor impoſed for any Eternal Reaſon or Internal Rectitude in the thing. Bloody Sacrifices were alſo purely Types of <hi>Chriſt</hi> to come; and therefore theſe were purely Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial, and ceaſe when that Law cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth: But <hi>Tythes</hi> as to the main, were not ſuch, and therefore remain in force ſtill. I might add, That the Prophets (who are not wont to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove the People for omiſſion of things purely Ceremonial) declaim againſt the <hi>Jews</hi> for detaining their <hi>Tythes;</hi> ſee <hi>Mal.</hi> iii. 10. And <hi>Nehemiah</hi> calls his care in this, <hi>a Good Deed,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring God to <hi>remember him for it, Nehem.</hi> xiii. 14. Nor are <hi>Tythes</hi> in all
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:107451:27"/>the New Teſtament reckon'd up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong things purely Ceremonial, or declared to be repealed, as <hi>Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion, Sacrifices, Waſhing, Jewiſh</hi> Difference of <hi>Meats,</hi> and <hi>Jewiſh Feaſts, &amp;c.</hi> are. Theſe are repealed by Name, but ſo are not <hi>Tythes,</hi> as being a thing that never were purely Ceremonial. I conclude, that part of our Subſtance being due to God, by the Natural and Divine Law; and the Inſpired Patriarchs being taught by Revelation, That the <hi>Tenth</hi> was this part, and the Prieſts of God were his Receivers: God himſelf having ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov'd alſo this payment by a renew'd claim, and an expreſs Aſſignation of his Right under the <hi>Levitical Law</hi> to the Prieſts for the time being: and the ſame God having the ſame Right ſtill to his part, and the ſame occaſion to uſe it, for the maintenance of his Miniſters at this Day: Hence I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it will follow, That (unleſs an expreſs repeal can be ſhewed) the <hi>Goſpel Miniſters</hi> in God's Name may juſtly claim <hi>Tythes</hi> as due to God and
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:107451:28"/>them ſtill, and that by a <hi>Divine Right</hi> too, which I will now more fully prove.</p>
               <p>§. 9. Having found ſure footing for the <hi>Divine Right of Tythes</hi> thus far; we will now go on with <hi>T. E.</hi> to conſider the third Period of time, <hi>viz. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nder the Goſpel.</hi> And firſt, we will begin with what the <hi>Quaker</hi> grants <hi>pag.</hi> 284. <hi>viz. That a Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance in general to the Miniſters of the Goſpel is Juſt, Reaſonable, and eſtabliſhed by a Divine Authority.</hi> Let him but ſtand to this Grant, and then it will follow, That the Miniſters of the Goſpel may claim a Maintenance in general <hi>Jure Divino:</hi> For, that Maintenance which is <hi>eſtabliſhed by Divine Authority</hi> is due <hi>Jure Divino.</hi> And why then ſhould not that Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance ſtill be ſo Due, which God directed before the Law, approved under the Law, and never repealed after the Law? If the Divine Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity hath eſtabliſhed a Maintenance, that ſuppoſeth it was ſuch a Mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance as was due before (according to
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:107451:28"/>
                  <hi>T. E. p.</hi> 318.) Now before the Goſpel times, the Maintenance paid to Gods Miniſters before the Law and under it, was <hi>Tythes.</hi> The Prieſthood of <hi>Melchiſedec,</hi> and of <hi>Levi,</hi> both were ſo maintained. And therefore if a new maintenance was (as <hi>T. E.</hi> ſpeaks) <hi>created,</hi> it might be ſomewhat elſe; But if a Maintenance be <hi>eſtabliſted,</hi> methinks it ſhould be <hi>Tythes.</hi> But to proceed: The places which you produced out of the <hi>New Teſtament</hi> for this <hi>Eſtabliſhment</hi> were 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> ix. and <hi>Gal.</hi> vi. 6. Now our <hi>Quaker,</hi> (as if he did already repent of his Conceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion) ſtrives to pervert theſe Texts by two Limitations. Firſt, <hi>The Apoſtle ſpeaks not ſo much</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>what the Maintenance is, as who they are from whom it is to be received,</hi> viz. <hi>Such as receive their Miniſtry, ſuch as believe them to be true Miniſters, ſuch as are taught by them.</hi> This is a notorious falſhood; for in the former place, <hi>viz.</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> ix. S. <hi>Paul</hi> is all along ſpeaking of the Miniſters Right to be main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained. And he ſhews what Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:107451:29"/>was due to the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, affirming, that Chriſt had or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained <hi>[even ſo]</hi> that we ſhould live of the Goſpel; that is, the Rights of God under the Goſpel, and the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgments made to him for the mercy therein revealed. The things of the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Temple and <hi>Altar</hi> were to be our Maintenance. And is not this to ſay, <hi>What the Mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance is?</hi> not a word in all this who ſhould pay it. And for the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of the <hi>Ox, the Souldier, the Shepherd, and Vine-dreſſer,</hi> Can theſe (as S. <hi>Paul</hi> brings them in) belong to thoſe who pay the Maintenance? Doth the <hi>Ox</hi> pay his Maſter Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance? or the Souldier give his Prince a Stipend? It is the Miniſters whom S. <hi>Paul</hi> compares to the <hi>Ox</hi> for profitableneſs, to the Souldier for hazards to be undergon, to the Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſer and Shepherd for pains and care. And all the Inſtances do ſhew the contrary to what this Abuſer of Scripture would ſqueeze out of them. The Ox muſt not be ſtarved, who is
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:107451:29"/>willing to work, though he be not actually imploy'd by him that feeds him: and ſo of the reſt. As for the latter place, <hi>Gal.</hi> vi. S. <hi>Paul</hi> tells them, they muſt give the Miniſters a part of <hi>all their good things;</hi> And is not that a declaring <hi>what the Maintenance is?</hi> The Apoſtle ſaith indeed, <hi>He that is taught in the Work</hi> muſt give this; But that is to diſtinguiſh <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians</hi> from <hi>Heathens,</hi> of which the World was then full. The <hi>Heathen</hi> was not bound to maintain the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel Miniſters, but <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>the Catechumen,</hi> the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> who was or might be taught, if his own lazi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, or pride, or obſtinacy hindered not: He was to give the <hi>Catechiſt</hi> or <hi>Miniſter,</hi> a part of all his goods. So that ſtill this proves not <hi>T. E</hi>'s fooliſh Inference, That none muſt contribute to a Miniſters Mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, but thoſe that are taught by him actually; for theſe Places ſay nothing againſt a Goſpel Miniſters receiving Maintenance from all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed <hi>Chriſtians;</hi> ſo that unleſs the
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:107451:30"/>
                  <hi>Quakers</hi> will own themſelves <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens,</hi> they cannot be excuſed from paying <hi>Tythes.</hi> And becauſe <hi>T. E.</hi> puts in this device meerly to excuſe his Fellow-<hi>Quakers</hi> from paying our Dues, I will let him ſee the fallacy of this Arguing: Firſt, conſidering the ſtate of things then; and ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, with reſpect to the condition they are in now. Firſt, According to the <hi>Quakers</hi> Principles, the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> of old were all immediately taught by inward Revelation; And if ſo, what need any Goſpel Miniſtery at all? what need of outward Means? what need had they to have any Teachers of the Word? Or with what equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty could this Teacher require main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of them, that had no occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for his Teaching at all? The <hi>Quaker</hi> forgot himſelf, when he gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>a Goſpel Miniſtry,</hi> and <hi>a general Maintenance</hi> for ſuch; ſince being taught without Means, overthrows all this. And the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> to whom S. <hi>Paul</hi> writ, might (upon theſe Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples) have pleaded an exemption
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:107451:30"/>from giving any Maintenance at all. Secondly, But now that there is (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to <hi>T. E.</hi>) a <hi>General Mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance eſtabliſhed by Divine Authority;</hi> and that pious Men have given a certain part of the profits of their own Lands for this maintenance; How unjuſt a thing is it for the <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers</hi> to with-hold this Maintenance upon pretence they are not (<hi>that is,</hi> They will not) be taught? Let this exact Parallel Caſe ſhew their diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty herein: Suppoſe a Pious Man an hundred Years ago, did endow a Free-School with twenty pounds <hi>per Annum,</hi> to be raiſed out of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits of a parcel of Ground, worth two hundred pounds <hi>per Annum;</hi> (that is, the <hi>Tenth</hi> part of the Profits) on con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition that all the Boys in ſuch a Town ſhould be taught <hi>gratis.</hi> Now ſuppoſe there be a Maſter legally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſted in this School, reſident at it, and ready to teach all the Boys of that Town, if they will come; it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſame trouble to him to teach ten as twenty: But it may be not
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:107451:31"/>above ten of twenty Boys within that Town will come to be taught, the reſt are Truants, and do not come. If <hi>T. E.</hi> himſelf were the Heir or Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to this two hundred pounds <hi>per Annum,</hi> would he think it juſt or rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable to ſtop ten pounds of the twenty, becauſe half the Boys do not come to be taught? Doth not the Maſters legal Title, and willingneſs to teach, give him a juſt right to the whole ſtipend? And will not all Men ſay, the Occupier of the two hundred pounds <hi>per Annum</hi> is a Knave to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold any part of it on this pretence? And yet this is the very caſe between the preſent Clergy and the <hi>Quakers;</hi> and ſurely none will think <hi>Chriſt</hi> or his Apoſtles would countenance the unjuſt detaining of other Mens Dues upon ſuch weak pretences.</p>
               <p>§. 10. <hi>T. E</hi>'s ſecond device to take off his former Grant of <hi>a General Maintenance eſtabliſhed by Divine Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,</hi> is pag. 286. <hi>That</hi> Chriſt <hi>hath expreſſely ſet down what this Goſpel Maintenance is,</hi> viz. <hi>onely meat and
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:107451:31"/>drink, Matth.</hi> x. 10. <hi>Luke</hi> x. 6, 7, 8. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> ix. 4. Truly this ſeems ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what ſtrange, that <hi>T. E.</hi> ſhould firſt ſay, Divine Authority had onely e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſhed a Maintenance <hi>in general,</hi> and in the next page but one, affirm, That the ſame Authority hath <hi>parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly expreſſed</hi> what this mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance muſt be. If <hi>Chriſt</hi> have allot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the particular Maintenance, then he hath not left it to generals; If he have eſtabliſhed it onely in general, then hath he not expreſſed the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars. One of theſe muſt be falſe, for indeed there is a manifeſt contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction. But moreover, this unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Interpreter never meddles with any place of Scripture without abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing it, and betraying the folly of that Spirit which is in him: For theſe pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of S. <hi>Matthew</hi> and S. <hi>Luke</hi> were ſpoken upon a particular occaſion, of ſending Diſciples into the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Cities of <hi>Judea,</hi> and <hi>Chriſt</hi> gave them ſpecial Rules appropriate to that Meſiage onely; and to apply theſe Rules to all Miniſters, or to the
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:107451:32"/>general Commiſſion he gave them afterwards, is the moſt ridiculous and abſurd thing imaginable. When the Apoſtles went to the prejudiced and unbelieving <hi>Jews</hi> with the firſt news of the Goſpel, Meat and Drink was as much as they could expect; and <hi>Chriſt</hi> bids them to take that and be contented. But he doth no where forbid them to receive more, if good Men freely gave it to them. And if <hi>Chriſt</hi> (according to <hi>T. E</hi>'s fancy) had determined Meat and Drink for the onely Goſpel Maintainance, then the Apoſtles had been great Sinners in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving the price of Poſſeſſions ſold and dedicated, <hi>Acts</hi> iv. <hi>&amp; Chap.</hi> v. If they had been taught by <hi>T. E</hi>'s Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, they muſt have returned them back again; and ſo muſt S. <hi>Paul</hi> have done the wages he took of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Churches, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> xi. 9. and thoſe liberal Preſents he received from the <hi>Philippians, Phil.</hi> iv. 18. Yea, and our <hi>Quaker</hi> muſt needs exclaim a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt S. <hi>Paul</hi> for daring to be ſo bold, that when his Maſter had expreſly
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:107451:32"/>ſet down Meat and Drink for the Goſpel Maintenance, He ſhould or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain that Believers ſhould give their Teachers part of all their Goods or good things, <hi>Gal.</hi> vi. 6. But we ſhall rather believe <hi>T. E.</hi> contradicts him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, than that the Apoſtles contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted their Maſter; and therefore ſhall conclude, That the <hi>Quaker</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſes our Lords words, in apylying them to be a determination of the onely Goſpel Maintainance; and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially if he would make them a ſtanding Rule for the ſucceeding <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry,</hi> after the Church was ſettled; the folly whereof I ſhall ſhew more fully §. 27.</p>
               <p>§. 11. And now having removed his vain exceptions, I ſhall go on to ſhew, That our Lord <hi>Jeſus</hi> and his Apoſtles have ſufficiently eſtabliſhed <hi>Tythes</hi> for the maintenance of the the Goſpel Miniſters; and that they may be proved alſo out of the <hi>Now Teſtament</hi> to be due <hi>Jure Divino.</hi> Firſt, in regard there is no repeal of <hi>Tythes</hi> in all the <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> which
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:107451:33"/>ſhews that our Lord left theſe in the ſame ſtate as he found them, (except<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing onely ſo far as concerned that Prieſtood which was to be aboliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) ſo far as they were Gods Right, and an acknowledgement of his Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy and Bounty; ſo far as they were Moral, and a neceſſary Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for his Miniſters; ſo far as they were founded on the Law of Nature, and Primitive Revelation, and grounded on an Eternal Reaſon, our Saviour did not revoke them; no, nor any thing elſe ſo eſtabliſhed: And if <hi>Tythes</hi> had been the only thing of this kind to be aboliſhed, it ſeems ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary there ſhould have been an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs Revocation of them; which we are ſure, there is not; and therefore <hi>expreſſa nocent, non expreſſa non no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent</hi>

                     <hi>Reg. Jur.</hi> 195.</note>. And we may reaſonably believe, That <hi>Jeſus</hi> intended they ſhould remain of Divine Right as they had been reputed alwayes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. Secondly, But this is not all, for there are poſitive Laws which do fairly intimate, that <hi>Tythes</hi> were to
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:107451:33"/>be the Maintenance of the Goſpel-Miniſters, when the Church was ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled.

The Tenth was a part ſo reaſonable and ſo known, ſo accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to God, ſo acknowledged by Men, and ſo certainly due to God before, that there is no reaſon to doubt but that this is the ſhare or portion of Goſpel-Miniſters. And ſo good Men of old underſtood it to be, and therefore communicated this Tenth Part to God and his Miniſters; and therein both expounded and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey'd this Apoſtolical Injunction. The People muſt Communicate, and that to the Goſpel-Miniſters; and they may claim <hi>Jure Divino</hi> to have
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:107451:35"/>a part of all their <hi>Good things;</hi> even the ſame part which was alwayes known to be God's Part, and ſo need not be particularly expreſſed here. There is but one Objection againſt this, <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>Tythes</hi> are not mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Goſpel or Epiſtles to be the very Part: To this therefore I reply, thirdly, There are very good Reaſons why <hi>Tythes</hi> are not mentioned in the New Teſtament by Name; <hi>viz.</hi> Firſt, To avoid all occaſion of ſcandal to the <hi>Jews,</hi> whoſe Prieſts were then in poſſeſſion of them; and though the <hi>Synagogue</hi> was dead, yet it was to be decently buried; whereupon many things were ſuffered a while to run in their old Channel, till the whole <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Polity was deſtroy'd. And it would have been uſed as a prejudice to the young beginnings of the Goſpel, if the Preachers had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently claimed the Maintenance, which others were legally inſtated in. And we ſee in S. <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> ix. that even where they had a right and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, in the firſt and unſettled
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:107451:36"/>times of <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> they did forbear to uſe it, that they might avoid of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence. Secondly, Nor was there any need for <hi>JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S</hi> to make any new Law for <hi>Tythes,</hi> ſince they were ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently declared to be due to God before, by Revelation, and Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, by Reaſon and Gods own choice; by the grounds on which they were given, and the ends for which they were employ'd. The World knew there was a <hi>Jus Divinum</hi> to the tenth part; ſo that our Lord was onely to declare what Prieſts it was to be paid unto, and who were to be his Recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers. And this he doth, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> ix. and <hi>Gal.</hi> vi. And thus it was in the caſe of Gods part of our Time under the Goſpel, as well as of his part of our Eſtate: One day in ſeven being ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently declared to be Gods part, <hi>Jeſus</hi> made no new Law about that at all; but left it on thoſe firm founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions upon which he found it ſettled. For, all which our Lord was to alter, was not in the proportion, (for a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth part is ſtill required) but in the
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:107451:36"/>Aſſignation of the day; and even for that he made no expreſs Law, but 'tis likely privately inſtructed his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples herein; who brought in the Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day Sabbath into the Church, by Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample rather than Conſtitution: And by degrees they did eſtabliſh it, carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the mean time ſo fair a reſpect to the <hi>Jewiſh-Sabbath,</hi> that for many years they obſerved both the <hi>Satur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day</hi> and <hi>Sunday</hi> alſo. Thirdly, Our Lord and his Apoſtles did not make a new Determination of the Tenth part by Name, becauſe the Devotion of the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> in thoſe dayes was ſo great, that they gave more than a <hi>Tenth</hi> freely, ſelling all and follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and beſtowing on the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles more than they were in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to receive. And as it were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent to make a Law for that Man to ſpend one day in ſeven religiouſly, who ſpends all his very Week dayes in Devotion and Religion; ſo it was in this caſe, our Lord <hi>JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S</hi> might expect that the joyful Meſſage of his Goſpel ſhould be ſo thankfull recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:107451:37"/>that thoſe to whom it was ſent, ſhould do as much freely to the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying his Meſſengers, as the ſervile <hi>Jews</hi> did by the compulſion of a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive Law. And he fore-ſaw that his Grace would open the hearts of Kings and Princes, and other devout Perſons, to give more than a <hi>Tenth</hi> part of their good things, to thoſe in his Name, and for his ſake, who were ſent to preach the Goſpel, <hi>Iſa.</hi> lx. 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And this accordingly came to paſs: for though our narrow-ſpirited <hi>Quakers</hi> think the ſmalleſt matters too much to be contributed to God's Service; thoſe Noble and large Souls thought the greateſt gifts too little in acknowledgement for the Mercies of the Goſpel. And ſince ſuch times were coming, our Lord might probably on purpoſe decline determining the proportion too ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly, that <hi>Chriſtians</hi> might have the opportunity of a voluntary Charity, and as S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks, might <hi>not do it grudgingly or of neceſſity;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>God loveth a chearful giver,</hi> 2
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:107451:37"/>
                  <hi>Cor.</hi> ix. 7. And this was more agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the freedom and ingenuity of Sons, which <hi>Chriſtians</hi> are compared to. And poſitive Laws were likely to be made when the decays of Piety and Charity did require them. Fourthly, I add, That the ſtate of the Church in thoſe dayes was ſuch, that Believers, though they were willing, could not have opportunity to pay <hi>Tythes</hi> regularly; nor could the Goſpel-Miniſters receive them. And as it was no prejudice to the <hi>Jewiſh</hi>-Prieſts, that there was little or no <hi>Tythes</hi> paid during their Fore-fathers wandring in the Wilderneſs; no more is it to us, that they were not paid re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularly in the times of Perſecution. Finally, our Lord <hi>JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S</hi> and the Apoſtles ſaid ſo much in the New Teſtament, that the Primitive <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> underſtood them to intend <hi>Tythes</hi> for the Goſpel-maintenance; and they ſaid enough to ſhew, that the Ancient Divine Right to the Tenth part ſhould be continued, and the Goſpel-Miniſters ſhould be the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivers
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:107451:38"/>of it: And it was neither ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary nor convenient they ſhould ſpeak more plainly in this matter: This being ſufficient to eſtabliſh the <hi>Divine Right of Tythes</hi> under the <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel,</hi> and to teach us that <hi>Tythes</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing originally due to <hi>God,</hi> and by <hi>Chriſt</hi> aſſigned to the <hi>Goſpel-Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters,</hi> are now due to them <hi>Jure Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vino.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 12. Now this <hi>Divine Right</hi> is much confirmed by the <hi>Voluntary de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication</hi> of the <hi>Tenth</hi> part to <hi>God</hi> by the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> afterwards. For what a Man dedicates to <hi>God</hi> and his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, <hi>God</hi> hath a <hi>Right</hi> to it by that Dedication, though it were a thing which was no way appropriate to <hi>God</hi> before, <hi>Acts</hi> v. 3, 4. <hi>Num.</hi> xxx. 2. As you do very well ſay in the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference: That if Tythes were not due by Divine appointment, this Dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion will make them due.</hi> Which the <hi>Quaker</hi> fancies to be a Relinquiſhing of the <hi>Divine Right,</hi> moſt maliciouſly inferring, <hi>pag.</hi> 287. That he perceives, though <hi>Chriſt</hi> deny them, yet if Men
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:107451:38"/>will grant them, it is enough to ſerve our turns. I know you never ſaid nor thought that <hi>Chriſt</hi> denyed <hi>Tythes,</hi> and ſince the <hi>Quaker</hi> affirms, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> doth deny them, let him pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the place of Scripture where <hi>Chriſt</hi> doth deny <hi>Tythes</hi> to be given or granted to <hi>Goſpel-Miniſters,</hi> or elſe he is a manifeſt Slanderer of <hi>Chriſt</hi> in this ſuggeſtion. But to proceed: You did prove this <hi>Voluntary dedication</hi> (with reſpect to this Nation) by King <hi>Ethelwolph's Charter.</hi> Not becauſe that was the firſt or oldeſt Donation of <hi>Tythes</hi> (as <hi>T. E.</hi> fooliſhly and falſly ſuggeſts <hi>p.</hi> 299.) for there were elder Dedications of <hi>Tythes</hi> than this, as well in this Nation as in other parts of <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> as you intimated in the <hi>Conference,</hi> when you ſaid, <hi>That as to this matter there was abundant ſatisfaction to be had, by conſulting Antiquaries and Church-Hiſtories, but eſpecially by King Ethelwolph's Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, &amp;c.</hi> 'Tis plain you knew there were other evidences, but you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanced in this as the fulleſt, (to this
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:107451:39"/>purpoſe, and for this Nation,) which remains at large upon Record. And becauſe the <hi>Quaker,</hi> dreading all high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Antiquity, and omitting all In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry into preceding <hi>Church-Hiſtory,</hi> doth cunningly ſuppoſe <hi>Tythes</hi> no ol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der among <hi>Chriſtians</hi> than this <hi>Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> or however to have ariſen from <hi>Popery,</hi> and accordingly bends all his force to evacuate this <hi>Charter,</hi> and prove thoſe times <hi>Popiſh;</hi> I ſhall crave leave to lay open his weakneſs and lamentable miſtakes in this following Method, which will continue the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of <hi>Tythes</hi> I have begun, baffle the Adverſary I have undertaken, and free you my worthy <hi>Friend</hi> from his aſperſions.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> I will look back into the Ages before K. <hi>Ethelwolph,</hi> and ſhew by what Authorities and Preſidents he made this <hi>Donation. Secondly,</hi> I will conſider the <hi>Donation</hi> it ſelf, and the ſtate of thoſe times in which it was made. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> I will note how it hath been confirmed ſince. And then <hi>fourthly,</hi> wipe off <hi>T.E.</hi>'s particular

               </p>
               <p>§. 13. <hi>Firſt,</hi> To look back into the Primitive Times: The <hi>Apoſtles</hi> having given a general Rule for the <hi>Faithful</hi> to communicate unto their <hi>Teachers</hi> in all good things; the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive <hi>Chriſtians</hi> did alwayes make liberal <hi>Oblations</hi> to their <hi>Paſtors,</hi> not only of Houſes and Lands as we read in <hi>Holy Scripture,</hi> but alſo of Money and other things; <hi>which being colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted every Lords day was delivered to the Biſhop,</hi> ſaith <hi>Juſtin Martyr</hi>

<pb n="76" facs="tcp:107451:40"/>whether they had not <hi>Tythes</hi> given them, by a Voluntary Devotion.

                     <hi>Irenaeus adverſ. Haer. lib.</hi> 5. <hi>c.</hi> 34.</note>. And a little after he ſaith, That <hi>as the the</hi> Jews <hi>gave their Tenths, ſo the</hi> Chriſtians <hi>gave all they had freely and chearfully to the Lords uſes, not giving leſs than they, as having a greater hope.</hi> And here we muſt note, That theſe <hi>Firſt-fruits</hi> which we find often men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in the Ancients as paid to the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Prieſts, were one ſort of <hi>Voluntary Tythe,</hi> preſcribed by <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> Law, being the firſt and beſt part of the Fruits of the Earth, offered ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemny to God by the owner: And if <hi>Tythes</hi> had been unlawful becauſe they were ſpoken of in <hi>Moſes</hi> Law,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:107451:40"/>
                  <hi>Firſt-fruits</hi> muſt have been ſo alſo. But we ſhall ſee the very firſt <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> dedicated their <hi>Firſt-fruits</hi> of all the Earths productions to God: And what was this but a <hi>Voluntary Tythe?</hi> Yea, I find the Names <hi>Firſt-fruits</hi> and <hi>Tythes</hi> frequently joyn'd, as ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifying the ſame thing; only the <hi>Greek</hi> Churches call theſe parts of the Earths productions <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, which the <hi>Latins</hi> more uſually term <hi>Deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mae.</hi> And it will be more evident that <hi>Firſt-fruits</hi> among the <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> were but another Name for <hi>Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thes,</hi> when we hear what follows. The <hi>Apoſtolical Canons</hi> (which were the Decrees of divers <hi>Chriſtian Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nods,</hi> made in the times of Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and of great Authority in the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Church) take notice of the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> in thoſe times, to bring their <hi>Firſt-fruits</hi> to the place of Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly, and by the Prieſt to offer them at the Altar; which looking ſomewhat like a Sacrifice, it was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, That neither <hi>Honey, Milk, ſtrong Liquors, Birds, nor living Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,

And this (being after that Epiſtle of the <hi>German Boniface,</hi> which aſſured us <hi>Tythes</hi> were then en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy'd by the Clergy) muſt be meant of <hi>Tythes.</hi> Again, K. <hi>Offa,</hi> (who had with all his Clergy condemned the Adoration of Images, and ſo was no Idolater,) <hi>An.</hi> 793. did give the <hi>Tenth</hi> of all that he had to the Church. By all which it appears, That from the time of the firſt general Converſion of the <hi>Saxons, Tythes</hi> were generally paid by the People, and received by the Clergy, even before any ſpecial Laws were made about them. And when Councils or Princes did make
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:107451:49"/>any Laws about them, they always do ſuppoſe them paid before. So that King <hi>Ethelwolph</hi> in this Donation doth rather confirm the Right of Tythes, than originally make them due. And it is to be noted, that till this time, the <hi>Saxons</hi> being divided into ſo many petty Kingdoms, were in continual broiles; and there was no one King who had power to col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect all the ſcattered Laws about Tythes, and confirm them for the whole Kingdom of <hi>England,</hi> till he, who was the firſt Hereditary Monarch of the <hi>Saxon</hi> Blood. He therefore, guided by theſe forreign Authorities and Examples, and led by the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom, Canons and Laws of the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral petty Kingdoms and Kings, doth now make this moſt famous Charter, to oblige the whole Kingdom to this Religious Payment, whoſe riſe and original we have thus far ſeen.</p>
               <p>§. 14. 2<hi rend="sup">ly</hi>, As to the Donation it ſelf, the immediate occaſion of it was the Compaſſion of this Religious and mild Prince towards his Subjects,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:107451:50"/>ſorely infeſted and harraſed with the <hi>Daniſh</hi> Invaſions.

Firſt, it was confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in that famous League between the <hi>Danes</hi> and <hi>Saxons,</hi> by <hi>Alfred</hi> or <hi>Alured</hi> the Great, Son of <hi>Ethelwolph,</hi> and <hi>Guthum</hi> the firſt Baptized King of the <hi>Danes, An.</hi> 887. and a Penalty added for ſuch as ſhould detain their <hi>Tythes</hi>

And again, by <hi>Athelſtan,</hi> (Son of the ſaid <hi>Edward,</hi>) in the Council of <hi>Gratelane, An.</hi> 928. <hi>Tythes</hi> alſo, by the Name of <hi>[Decimas ſeminum Primitias],</hi> are again enjoined by <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mund</hi> Brother of <hi>Athelſtane,</hi> in a great Council of the Clergy and Laity at <hi>London, An.</hi> 944. King <hi>Edgar</hi> in open Senate renewed the Law for Tythes; and made it a forfeiture of Nine parts to detain the <hi>Tenth, An.</hi> 967. And in his Canons he calls <hi>Tythes, [Things which by Right are to be paid to God]</hi> As they are alſo by <hi>Ethelred [The Rights due to God]</hi> when he confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:107451:51"/>the <hi>Donation of Tythes</hi> in the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Council at <hi>Aenham, An.</hi> 1009. The ſame ratified alſo by <hi>Canutus,</hi> and King <hi>Edgar</hi>'s Penalty revived, <hi>An.</hi> 1032. And laſtly, by King <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the Confeſſor,</hi> in thoſe Laws of his which were collected and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by King <hi>William the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queror</hi> at his Entring upon the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Crown; as all other Kings of <hi>England</hi> ſince have done. The particulars are too many to mention, and the Thing is ſufficiently known. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we will only add, that the very firſt words of <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> (the foundation of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Liberties,) confirms all that had been given to the Church. And Sir <hi>Hen. Spelman</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms, theſe Grants had been ratified in thirty nine ſeveral great Councils and Parliaments before the Reformation. And we all know, that our Proteſtant Princes have confirmed the Right of <hi>Tythes</hi> as fully as any of their Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors; and with their Proteſtant Parliaments have given greater ſtrength and ſecurity to the Clergy in
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:107451:51"/>poſſeſſion of them, than ever they had before; and made better Laws for puniſhing thoſe who do detain them. Now if all this, added to the antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent <hi>Divine Right,</hi> will not amount to make a valid Deed of Gift, then no Man can ſecure any thing to his Poſterity. For this Donation hath been adviſed by Fathers, enjoyned by Councils, practiſed by forreign Princes, ſolemny made by the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Conſent of the three Eſtates with the King, frequently confirmed by as general Conſent in every Age, and the benefit thereof enjoyed for 800 Years by thoſe to whom the Donati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was made. And thus the Clergy have a ſecond Title to the Tythes: They were originally due to God, and afterwards freely given by the right Owners, and that Gift confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by their Poſterity. Due by the Laws of God, due by the Gift of the Owners, and allowed by the Laws of Man: which being thus far proved, I hope our <hi>Quaker</hi>'s trifling Objections will now eaſily be diſpelled.</p>

And if all the good Acts of <hi>Papiſts</hi> (in the true ſenſe) and all their Charters and Donations be void, meerly becauſe made and done by <hi>Papiſts;</hi> then all the Charters of our Kings, all the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowments of Hoſpitals and Schools, <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> and all Publick Acts for ſome hundreds of years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore K. <hi>Henry VIII.</hi> would be void: Which Principle would deſtroy the Maintenance of the Poor, the Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges of Cities, and the Freedom of all <hi>Engliſh</hi> Subjects. But this <hi>Quaker</hi> muſt be more wary than thus to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinge all Eſtabliſhments; and let him note, That if <hi>Ethelwolph</hi> had been a <hi>Papiſt</hi> in <hi>other things,</hi> yet in this Act
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:107451:53"/>he was none, unleſs <hi>Abraham</hi> were a <hi>Papiſt</hi> before <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s time, and <hi>Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gen</hi> with the Fathers afterwards; yea, unleſs our Proteſtant Princes and Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments be <hi>Papiſts</hi> alſo.</p>
               <p>§. 17. Secondly, he objects, <hi>p.</hi> 290. <hi>That Tythes were given to maintain the</hi> Popiſh <hi>Clergy].</hi> This is a miſtake alſo; for <hi>Ingulphus</hi> ſaith, <q>
                     <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſam dotaverat Eccleſiam Anglica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nam:</hi>
                  </q> it was for the Maintenance of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Clergy, who had a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarch of their own in thoſe dayes, and were a Church of themſelves, not holding all the opinions of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, nor profeſſing any Canonical obedience to the <hi>Pope</hi> (which was firſt done by <hi>Ralph</hi> Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Canterbury, Anno</hi> 1115.) and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they cannot juſtly be called a <hi>Popiſh</hi> Clergy. But ſuppoſe again, the <hi>Saxon</hi> Prieſts had been <hi>Papiſts;</hi> that would not have made a Donation of Tythes invalid: becauſe Tythes are God's Right, and the Grant was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to God
<note n="(g)" place="margin">Ad ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viendum Deo ſoli, Ingulph. Deo contulit. Math. Weſt.</note>. The Clergy of that Age were God's only publick
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:107451:53"/>Miniſters (and the <hi>Quaker</hi>'s private Teaching was not then invented); the Donors ſuppoſed them a good Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry, and as ſuch endowed them, for they eſteem'd them to be God's Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivers: and ſince there is no fault in God, if there had been a fault in the Servant, that could not prejudice the Maſter's Title. Beſides, Almighty God hath now provided himſelf of Miniſters that are no <hi>Papiſts,</hi> but the moſt conſiderable Enemies to <hi>Popery</hi> in all the World; ſo that if they had been a <hi>Popiſh</hi> Clergy, and forfeited their own Right, they could not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit ours; and yet it is from a Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Clergy that the <hi>Quakers</hi> would take the Tythes. Again, <hi>T. E.</hi> muſt know, that erroneous opinions in the Clergy do not make void the Rights which they have by the Laws of God or Man: For the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Prieſts in <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s time were very erroneous in judgement, and yet <hi>Chriſt</hi> pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces they had a Right to Tythes, even to thoſe ſmall <hi>Tythes</hi> not expreſſed in God's Law, but Dedicated by the
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:107451:54"/>
                  <hi>Phariſees;</hi> for, ſaith he, <q>

                  <hi>Matth.</hi> xxiii. 23. ſo doubtleſs we may ſay, Though that Clergy were erroneous, yet <hi>Ethelwolph</hi> ought to have given them God's due, and the People ought to have paid it to them: If they were erroneous, neither Prince nor People knew it, and they did not give theſe to maintain their Errors (as <hi>T. E.</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liciouſly inſinuates) but to maintain that which they believed to be a good Miniſtry, and the true Worſhip of God: and therefore the Donation remains good. If I give alms to a poor <hi>Turk, Papiſt</hi> or <hi>Quaker,</hi> he is malicious who ſayes I do it to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain his Errors, when I do it to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve his wants

However, will any plead, if I endow an Alms-houſe, and ſuppoſe the Beads-men to be good Men, but am miſtaken, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter my deceaſe it appears the Perſons which were choſen were of evil Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples or wicked Life; that this makes my Donation to be wholly void? We may ſay, ſuch evil Perſons ought to be
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:107451:54"/>put out, and better put in; but be the Perſons good or bad, the Gift given to God ſtands good and is ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>revocable.</p>
               <p>§. 18. Thirdly, The <hi>Quaker</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, <hi>ibid.</hi> 
                  <q>That <hi>he did it upon evil motives. For the good of our Souls, and the forgiveneſs of our ſins</hi> (are the words of the Charter); <hi>which ſhews it to be an effect of that Popiſh Doctrine of meriting Salvation by Good works, and that he gave this as an expiation for his ſins.</hi>
                  </q>] 'Tis ſomewhat ſtrange that <hi>T. E.</hi> ſhould reckon both theſe for evil motives; and it is the firſt time that I ever heard it called an evil motive, to be moved to do a good work, <q>
                     <hi>For the good of our Souls.</hi>
                  </q> Again, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of Remiſſion of his ſins was a good motive in it ſelf, onely he took an ill courſe to obtain it, if he ſought Expiation by Good works; to merit pardon and ſalvation by good works, is now a Doctrine of the groſſer <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maniſts,</hi> and I fear of ſome <hi>Quakers</hi> alſo, who (ſlighting the merit and
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:107451:55"/>neceſſity of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s death) aſcribe Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation to the <hi>following the Light with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in;</hi> yea, <hi>T. E.</hi> himſelf pleads, that there is no Salvation unleſs we have a ſinleſs perfection, and (as if <hi>Chriſt</hi> had never died) poſitively affirms, <q>Whereſoever there is ſin, there is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo condemnation,</q> 
                  <hi>p.</hi> 97. Now he that looks for Salvation by his perfection, doth hold that <hi>Popiſh</hi> Doctrine of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riting Salvation by Good works; and he that proudly ſays, he hath no ſin to be remitted, renders <hi>Chriſt's</hi> death as uſeleſs, as he that believes he ſhall obtain remiſſion by his Good works. And therefore I doubt the <hi>Quaker</hi> will be found to be more a <hi>Papiſt</hi> than K. <hi>Ethelwolph:</hi> For this <hi>Popiſh</hi> Doctrine of Merit and Expiation by Good works is not ſo old as that Age; yea, the learned Biſhop <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſher</hi> proves, that this Doctrine was not received here in <hi>Alſelm</hi>'s days; for in his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections to thoſe who viſited the Sick are theſe Queſtions and Anſwers, <q>A. <hi>Brother, doſt thou believe thou canſt not be ſaved but by the

And 'tis evident from S. <hi>Bernard, Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>randus,</hi> and others, that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> it ſelf was not for Merits in this groſs ſenſe, of 300 or 400 years after <hi>Ethelwolph</hi>'s time: And for his words in this Charter, and ſome ſuch like as are to be found among the moſt Orthodox Fathers, they mean no more, than that they hoped theſe good fruits meet for Repentance would be acceptable to God, ſo that he perceiving their purpoſes of well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doing, might of his great mercy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow that pardon on them, which <hi>Chriſt</hi> alone merited: And hence the good King adds, that they gave theſe alſo, <q>
                     <hi>That the Prieſts might ſo much
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:107451:56"/>the more fervently pour out their Prayers to God without ceaſing for them:</hi>
                  </q> So that we may perceive, they did not think this good work alone could expiate their ſins, or me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit Salvation, without God's mercy; and to that end, they deſired the dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and importunate Prayers of the Church for them, ſince they had learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from S. <hi>James,</hi> That the Prayers of God's Miniſters were a good means to obtain Remiſſion, <hi>James</hi> v. 14, 15. But let us here alſo ſuppoſe they were led by thoſe evil motives which <hi>T. E</hi>'s malice falſly lays to their charge; will he ſay, that all the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations of <hi>Papiſts</hi> (who really are led by theſe Motives) are invalid to thoſe to whom they are made? If ſo, then all the Schools, Hoſpitals, and other charitable Gifts of <hi>Popiſh</hi> Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation are void; which is a ridiculous Aſſertion. The giving any thing to a pious uſe upon evil motives, may endanger the Giver's loſing his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in Heaven, but it will not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive the Receivers of the benefit of
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:107451:56"/>ſuch a Gift on Earth; and if we might not lawfully enjoy a Gift, unleſs the Giver were moved by juſt and good motives to give it, we could ſcarce enjoy any Donation of <hi>Papiſt</hi> or <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant;</hi> ſince we cannot certainly know whether they were induced to it by good or bad motives. We con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude therefore, That the <hi>Quaker</hi> falſly accuſes our Anceſtors, in calling them <hi>Papiſts,</hi> and their Clergy <hi>Popiſh,</hi> and in affirming they were acted by evil motives. And yet if all theſe had been as true as they are falſe, it had been hurtful only to themſelves, but doth not at all make their pious Donations of Tythes to God and his Miniſters to be void.</p>
               <p>Some ſlighter Cavils he hath, <hi>p.</hi> 292, 293. As firſt, his calling the Clergy of that Age <q>
                     <hi>Apoſtates and corrupt,</hi> for being ſo grateful to their Benefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors, as to engage <hi>to ſing David's Pſalms,</hi> and <hi>to make Prayers twice a Week for them, that God would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward their bounty, and pardon their ſins.</hi>
                  </q> 'Tis true, they called theſe
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:107451:57"/>Prayers <hi>[Miſſas]</hi> a name uſed very innocently and anciently by the <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin</hi> Fathers; but theſe Prayers were far different from the <hi>Miſsal</hi> of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> whoſe Offices were firſt brought in here by <hi>Oſmund</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Salisbury, An.</hi> 1096. there being great variety before. Again, he quarrels with the <hi>Charter,</hi> for the Names of the Saints annexed to it, in whoſe honour it is ſaid to have been made: But <hi>T.E.</hi> may note, that there is not one of the three Mentioners of this Clauſe that agree in it; ſo that it is very probable, the Hiſtorians living ſome Ages after, might (as their man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner is) put in this leſs material paſſage in the Phraſe of their own Times, of which dealing in other caſes I could give many Inſtances: however, it was given to God in the firſt place, and no mention of the Saints in all the body of the <hi>Charter;</hi> and it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain they did not worſhip the Saints in thoſe dayes: and ſure it is no great crime in the ſecond place to give a reſpect and honour to them, even the
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:107451:57"/>ſame we do to ſuch as are alive: But our <hi>Quakers</hi> deſpiſe all the old Saints, and think no Saints deſerve ſo much honour as themſelves. In the next place, he quarrels at you, for that you will not grant <q>
                     <hi>They gave Tythes in a blind and ſuperſtitious zeal;]</hi>
                  </q> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as we have learned from S. <hi>Paul, It is good to be zealous alwayes in a good thing,</hi> Gal. iv. Now I have made it evident, It is a good thing to grant Tythes to God's Service; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore though our Anceſtors were blind and ſuperſtitious in other things, yet not in this Donation, herein their zeal was commendable. Again, whereas you had ſaid, <q>
                     <hi>Tythes were given to God for the mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of his Miniſtry, T. E.</hi>
                  </q> inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prets this to be <q>

                  </q> which is a malicious and falſe inference, ſince the Prieſthood to whoſe maintenance theſe Tythes were given, was neither Idolatrous, nor the Prieſthood of the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> but it is certain
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:107451:58"/>the Donors intended them to the right Miniſters of God; and I make no doubt they were ſuch to whom they gave them: and if there were ſome errors among them, that takes not away the Character of their Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, nor their Title to Tythes, ſince <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelf declared, Tythes ought to be paid to the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Prieſts, <hi>Matth.</hi> xxiii. 23. and ſent <hi>Judas</hi> out to preach the Goſpel.</p>
               <p>§ 1.9. The <hi>Quaker</hi> proceeds <hi>p.</hi> 294, 295. to give us ſome proofs of his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honeſty, as he has done of his igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance before; for whereas you affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, That <q>

<pb n="116" facs="tcp:107451:60"/>why they were kept, but why they were put to that particular holy uſe, and to no other: And would God the Quaking Speakers would remember theſe Cenſers at this day, when they uſurp the Prieſt's Office. Another ingenious note of <hi>T. E</hi>'s is this, That <q>
                     <hi>The Cenſers were not permitted to be uſed as Cenſers, but being made into broad plates for the covering of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar, the property of them was altered before they were allowed to be uſed.]</hi>

                  <hi>The property altered!</hi> hath not his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Teaching learned him to ſpeak ſenſe? the form of the Cenſers was altered indeed, but the property was not altered at all. The Lord had the property of them when they were Cenſers, and he had the ſame property in them when they are made into Plates. The property of a a thing is not altered, unleſs it change its Maſter. If I have a property in a piece of Gold by a Friend's Gift, and after ſee fit to melt it into a Ring for my own uſe; the form is changed, but the property is the ſame. But to
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:107451:60"/>the Caſe before us: As the Cenſers being once given to God, muſt remain to be his ſtill; and though they might be uſed to another holy uſe, yet they could not be alienated to a prophane or common uſe; ſo we may learn, it ought to be in other ſacred Dedications: If the things were offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to maintain an evil way of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, they may be applied to maintain a right way of Worſhip; but ſtill they muſt remain ſacred, God's pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty in them ſhould not be altered.</p>

<pb n="119" facs="tcp:107451:61"/>the Divine Laws, theſe Aliena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions were not allowable; and they have perſwaded ſuch as can ſpare them, freely to return them to pious uſes, or however to make proviſion for a Miniſter out of them, ſufficient to inſtruct the People where the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits do ariſe; but none of us ever uſed the Impropriators as the <hi>Quakers</hi> have done us: we know the preſent Laws give them a legal Title to them, and where we are lyable we pay chearfully to them; if their own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences be ſatisfied to keep them, we do not moleſt them; but if we do ſay, It is more pious and more Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian freely to reſtore them, I hope this is no juſt cauſe of offence: But for this matter, ſee Dr. <hi>Baſier</hi>'s <hi>Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge arraigned,</hi> and that excellent Book called <hi>The larger Work about Tythes,</hi> written by Sir <hi>Henry Spelman,</hi> whoſe Example anſwered his Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions; for he gave an Impropriation back to the Church out of his own Eſtate, and perſwaded divers Great Men to do the like; and many other

That this Donation of Tythes is invalid. Secondly,</hi> and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe they were <hi>Papiſts</hi> in ſome things, yet it follows not that giving Tythes was a <hi>Popiſh</hi> Act; for all the Acts of <hi>Papiſts</hi> are not <hi>Popiſh.</hi> The <hi>Saxons</hi> of thoſe dayes obſerved the <hi>Lords Day,</hi> and made good Laws for its obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,

E.</hi> muſt know, it is a <hi>Popiſh</hi> opinion, That the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> can exempt Men from pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Tythes. And therefore if our Anceſtors who gave Tythes had been <hi>Papiſts,</hi> in this Act they had been good <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> and differed not from the opinion of the Reformed Church. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> he begins too low by far; for if <hi>Popery</hi> came not into the Church till about ſeven hundred years after <hi>Chriſt</hi> (according to <hi>T.E.</hi>'s proofs) then Tythes were much an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cienter than <hi>Popery;</hi> for they were paid and declared to be due to the <hi>Chriſtian Church</hi> at leaſt five hundred years before: and <hi>T.

                  <hi>Origen, Cyprian,</hi> S. <hi>Ambroſe, Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoſtom, Hierome</hi> and <hi>Auguſtine</hi> to have been <hi>Papiſts,</hi> if he will make out, that Tythes came into the Church with <hi>Popery:</hi> Or if he pretend he meant it only of this Church of <hi>England,</hi> we have ſhewed Tythes were paid gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, and ſpecially granted in ſome parts of this Kingdom, long before <hi>Ethelwolph</hi>'s time; ſo that he may twattle thus to pleaſe his ignorant <hi>Quakers,</hi> but we diſcern the empti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and impertinence of theſe Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations, which are ſo nothing to the purpoſe, that they deſerve not to be conſidered at all.

               <p>§. 22.

                  </q>] It is ſtrange the <hi>Quaker</hi> ſhould ſay ſo, who before declared himſelf to be for Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Teaching, and who <hi>p.</hi> 229. affirms, <q>The very Babes in <hi>Chriſt</hi> by the anointing knew all things: Yea, if the Saints have not the Spirit in them, ſo as to teach them all things, they have not the Spirit at all,</q> 
                  <hi>p.</hi> 230. What then doth <hi>T. E.</hi> make of theſe Martyrs, not ſo much as little Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren? were they wholly without the
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:107451:70"/>Spirit? or were they taught media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tely? ſince mediate and carnal Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge (as he calls it) comes by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees; but all that <hi>T.

We add, That the <hi>Quaker</hi> thought <hi>Bradford</hi> a very Spiritual and knowing Man, (with ſome others of that time) when he fancied he ſpoke on his ſide, <hi>p.</hi> 275. but now when he ſpeaks againſt him, he rejects his Teſtimony, on pretence <q>
                     <hi>That he and the reſt of his Fellow-Martyrs liv'd at the very dawning of the day of Reformation.</hi>
                  </q> Very plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant! Let me then ask the <hi>Quaker</hi> what hour of the Morning it was when his other Martyrs (as he falſly calls them) <hi>Thorp, Swinderby, Brute,</hi> and <hi>Wickliffe</hi> lived? If it was but day-break in <hi>Cranmer</hi>'s time, it was
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:107451:71"/>dark as mid-night in <hi>Wickliffe</hi>'s; if <hi>Cranmer</hi> and <hi>Bradford</hi> had but little light, <hi>Wickliffe</hi> and <hi>Thorp</hi> had none at all; and therefore unleſs they had Cats-eyes they could not ſee them; So that 'tis wonder <hi>T. E.</hi> ſhould pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre their Judgements before theſe. But further, If to reject Tythes had been a Truth, it was diſcovered (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to <hi>T. E.</hi>) long before <hi>Cran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi>'s time, and he with his Aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciates who lived nearer Sun-riſe, and ſo could ſee better than <hi>Thorpe, &amp;c.</hi> were not ignorant of this Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but eſteemed it erroneous; and though they followed <hi>Wickliffe</hi> in ſome things, yet in this they receded from him: ſo that it cannot be ſaid they ſaw not this opinion; but ſeeing it, they rejected it: And I am ſure their judgement herein is far more conſiderable than <hi>Wickliffe</hi>'s or his followers, being both better Men, and of far greater underſtanding; for theſe Martyrs were conſtant to the death, and ſealed our Faith with their Blood; whereas moſt of thoſe
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:107451:71"/>Oppoſers of Tythes recanted openly, and proved Apoſtates, as Mr. <hi>Fox</hi> himſelf confeſſeth: So that the <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker</hi> is a manifeſt Lyar in giving ſuch Renegado's the Name of Martyrs: and as for <hi>Wickliffe</hi> himſelf, he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf received Tythes, and died quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Parſon of <hi>Lutterworth</hi> in <hi>Leiceſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire,</hi> and ſo was no Martyr: nor did he abſolutely reject Tythes as <hi>T.

<pb n="147" facs="tcp:107451:75"/>that the <hi>Tythes</hi> were ſetled up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them by vertue of the beſt Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations imaginable; and therefore the <hi>Prieſts</hi> Claim is better than the <hi>Elwoods,</hi> on this account, that we can be ſure we came well to our Right at firſt. Now the Law find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a <hi>Prieſt</hi> and an <hi>Elwood</hi> both claiming by vertue of ſeveral anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Donations, and both in poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their ſeveral Eſtates; and looking on them as both Subjects, and both Perſons whoſe Rights the Government and Laws ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend: the Law, I ſay, confirms both their Eſtates and Rights to them and their Succeſſors.

               <p>§. 24. He goes on in his folly, and ſaith, <hi>pag.</hi> 314. <hi>If the Caſe of the Prieſt and of T. E. as to Temporal Right be equal, then the Prieſt muſt acknowledge he is no more a Miniſter of Chriſt than T. E. at leaſt, that he doth not claim them as a Miniſter of Chriſt, any more than T.

<pb n="149" facs="tcp:107451:76"/>by a Soldier, then by a Merchant, then by a Woman; and all theſe in their ſeveral turns may have an equal Temporal right to this Eſtate, though they be every one of different Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacities. And if it be ſeveral Eſtates, and the Perſons enjoying them as different as can be in their Capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, the ſame Laws may give an equal Right to them all, without altering their various Capacities. Suppoſe the King have by the Law a Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Right to one Eſtate, and ſome of His Subjects an equal Right to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Eſtate; you ſhall hear <hi>T. E</hi>'s wiſe way of arguing: <q>
                     <hi>The King claims a Temporal thing; ſo doth the Subject: The King claims by a Temporal Right; ſo doth the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject: The King hath no need of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture to prove his Right; no more hath the Subject: Yet for all this, their Claim is not one and the ſame, they muſt ſtay there; the King muſt acknowledge himſelf no more a King than the Subject, or elſe the Caſes are not parallel.</hi>
                  </q> Thus <hi>he
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:107451:77"/>takes his Quakers by the noſe, and would cokes them into a conceit,</hi> That all <hi>Prieſts</hi> muſt be <hi>Elwoods,</hi> or all <hi>El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woods Prieſts,</hi> before they can have equal Temporal Rights. This is the inſpired Oracle of Law and Goſpel, who doth not know how a Judge and a Plowman, a Man and a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, a <hi>Prieſt</hi> and an <hi>Elwood,</hi> can have equal Rights and Claims, unleſs the Judge be no more a Judge than the Plowman, or the Manno more a Man than the Woman, or the <hi>Prieſt</hi> no more a <hi>Prieſt</hi> than the <hi>Elwood.</hi> This is the rare Logician, who can diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh ſo nicely between the <hi>Man</hi> and the <hi>Capacity,</hi> that one would think he had learned of the <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> or been educated among the Murderers of our late Bleſſed King, who fought againſt the <hi>Man,</hi> and put him to death, but yet did not oppoſe the <hi>King</hi> all the while; which our Laws call a <hi>Traiterous Poſition.</hi> At this rate one might ſtrip <hi>T.

               <p>§. 25. <hi>Ignorance is the Mother of Admiration;</hi> and therefore it is not ſtrange to find <hi>T. E.</hi> wondring at the following Particulars, <hi>pag.</hi> 316. Firſt, <hi>Why Spiritual Preferments ſhould be held by a Temporal Right, unleſs it be becauſe we have no Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Right to them?]</hi> The Clergy had a Spiritual Right to <hi>Tythes,</hi> before any Humane Laws gave them a Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:107451:78"/>Right to them; or elſe S. <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rom,</hi> and other Primitive Fathers, who lived on <hi>Tythes,</hi> did live upon that which they had no Right to at all. Now the Humane Laws finding the Clergy had a Spiritual Right to <hi>Tythes,</hi> did confirm that firſt Title, by adding a ſecond; for when they give the Clergy a Temporal Right to <hi>Tythes,</hi> the Law-givers and Laws ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe their antecedent Right, which <hi>T. E.</hi> confeſſes, <hi>pag.</hi> 333. And our <hi>Elwood</hi> hath an equitable Right to his Eſtate, antecedent to the Legal Right which the Laws of the Land give him to it: now the addition of this Legal Right doth ſuppoſe and confirm, not deny or deſtroy his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitable Right. If he ask, what mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved our Temporal Governors more eſpecially to add this Legal Right to the <hi>Prieſts</hi> antecedent Spiritual and Divine Right; it may be it was on purpoſe to prevent the knavery of ſuch who will pay nothing for Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience-ſake, and of ſuch as would pervert the Scripture by Inſpired
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:107451:78"/>Expoſitions, and call the Fathers, Councils, and Princes, who gave or approved <hi>Tythes, Papiſts and Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters;</hi> and the Miniſters of God, to whom <hi>Tythes</hi> were given, <hi>Idolatrous, Popiſh, &amp;c.</hi> meerly under this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, to defraud them of their Dues. Hence they made Laws, that Spiritual Donations ſhould be held alſo by Temporal Right, that Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Penalties might compel thoſe to be honeſt, who neither valued nor feared other things. And this is the Reaſon given by <hi>Hen.</hi> VIII. in <hi>T. E. pag.</hi> 333. yea, by S. <hi>Paul,</hi> when he ſaith, <hi>The Law is not made for a Righteous man,</hi> 1 Tim. i. 9.

E.</hi> have ſome new Revelation con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning this Commiſſion of <hi>Chriſt</hi> to his Diſciples, the old words of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture will not bear this ſenſe: For, as we read the place, this was a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Direction for that private and particular Meſſage on which the Apoſtles were to be ſent to the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of <hi>Judea;</hi> and if this Order of taking Meat and Drink then, were a perpetual and general Rule to all Miniſters to the Worlds end, ſo muſt alſo all the reſt of the Rules there mentioned be: and if ſo, then it will follow, 1. That Miniſters may not preach to any <hi>Gentiles</hi> or <hi>Sama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritans, Mat.</hi> x. 5. 2. That they muſt ſtill heal the Sick, cleanſe the Lepers, raiſe the Dead, caſt out Devils, <hi>v.</hi> 8.
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:107451:80"/>3.

                  </q> arrogantly telling them in <hi>Corah</hi>'s phraſe (having forgot the Cenſers already, <hi>Numb.</hi> xvi.), <q>
                     <hi>They take too much upon them, unleſs they can ſhew where Chriſt gave them ſuch Authority.]</hi>
                  </q> But let me ask this bold Queſtioniſt, where <hi>Chriſt</hi> forbid them to give a better Mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance? He bid the Apoſtles be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with Meat and Drink; but he did not forbid them to take more, if it were freely given: nor did <hi>Chriſt</hi> any where forbid thoſe to whom the Goſpel ſhould be preached, to give them any more. It ſeems by <hi>T. E.</hi> that whatever any gave, more than Meat and Drink, was a contradicting <hi>Chriſts</hi> Command, if it were but a Coat to cover their nakedneſs (which is not mentioned in <hi>Chriſts</hi> Command): No doubt he will ask the Primitive Believers, who gave them order to ſell their Eſtates, and give them to the Apoſtles? He will ſay, <hi>They took too much upon them.</hi> Was ever ſo much Folly and Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:107451:81"/>conjoyn'd? Is it any affront to <hi>Chriſt</hi> to give nobly to his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice? Or did <hi>Solomon</hi> do any injury to God, to take away the ambulato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Tabernacle, fit for the unfixed State of the Church, and build a ſtately Temple? Such <hi>exchange</hi> can be no <hi>robbery.</hi> But becauſe <hi>T. E.</hi> ſo pertly calls for a Command, I ſhall tell him, that an Hint is a Command to a Soul that loves God: There is enough in that Divine Precept to put the forward Charity of a devout Chriſtian upon giving <hi>Tythes</hi> at leaſt, <hi>Gal.</hi> vi. 6. <hi>to give their Teachers a ſhare of all their good things;</hi> and 'tis ſure they will not give a little ſhare, who read, <hi>They that ſow plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully ſhall reap plentifully,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> ix. 6. The <hi>Tenth part</hi> was given by the Patriarchs, choſen by God the Father, paid by the <hi>Jews,</hi> and not repealed by <hi>Chriſt:</hi> and why ſhould they give any leſs or other part? Here then was their Authority to give <hi>Tythes</hi> to Gods Miniſters. <hi>Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> He ſays, <q>
                     <hi>For any Magiſtrate to
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:107451:82"/>ſet out Tythes for a Maintenance, is a direct oppoſition to Chriſt;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>they were commanded by God in the Levitical Law, and Chriſt hath taken away Prieſts, Law, and Tythes all together.]</hi>
                  </q> How proves he this? By <hi>Hebr.</hi> vii.] The Verſe he cunningly leaves out, being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious to himſelf he had father'd a Lie on that Chapter, in which there is not one word of <hi>Chriſts</hi> taking away <hi>Tythes,</hi> no nor in any place of the <hi>New Teſtament. Chriſt</hi> took away that <hi>Prieſthood;</hi> but he left another <hi>Prieſthood,</hi> which needs as much, and deſerves as good a Maintenance as that of <hi>Levi;</hi> and therefore he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver repealed the Law of <hi>Tythes.</hi> And ſince it was ſo likely, that <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians</hi> ſhould pitch upon this <hi>ſame Tenth part,</hi> which <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi> had known to be conſecrated to theſe Uſes; if <hi>Chriſt</hi> had diſallowed this part, it ſeems neceſſary there ſhould have been an expreſs Caution in Scripture againſt <hi>Tythes:</hi> but ſince there is no ſuch thing, but onely a
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:107451:82"/>pretended Revelation to <hi>T. E.</hi> and the reſt of his <hi>Quakers,</hi> no body will believe <hi>Tythes</hi> were deſigned by <hi>Chriſt</hi> to be repealed. And indeed <hi>T.

Is it not uſual for ſuch as ſettle their Eſtates, to oblige their Heirs for ever to pay out of it a Sixth, Eighth, or Tenth part of the Rents of that Eſtate, which the Heirs many hundred years after are obliged to pay to the Uſes appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the firſt Donor?

                  </q> This is his main Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which he glories in much, and repeats often; but there is nothing at all in it, but Miſtake, Falſhood, and Impiety. For, if <hi>T. E.</hi> will grant, That it is lawful for a Lord to lay a perpetual Rent-charge upon his Eſtate, to be paid in Money, (than which, nothing is more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, or more legal) he muſt grant it is as lawful for this Lord to charge his Eſtate with paying the Tenth part of the Profits <hi>in ſpecie:</hi> For, doth not the raiſing the Sum of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:107451:86"/>(ſetled by Rent-charge), ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe 10 <hi>l.</hi> or 20 <hi> l. per Annum,</hi> include the Labour, Sweat, Care, Charge, Skill, and Induſtry of the Husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, as well as the preparing the <hi>Tythe?</hi> Nay, the paying a Rent-charge in Money requires more La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, Charge, and Pains, than pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Tythes in ſpecie;</hi> for the Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandman muſt not onely get his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits together, but carry (ſuppoſe) his Corn into the Barn, threſh it, winnow it, and carry it out again and ſell it; and after all this, he muſt pay this Money, for which ſuch a proportion of his Profits were ſold: Whereas <hi>Tythe</hi> being paid <hi>in ſpecie,</hi> needs onely be got together, and the Husbandman hath no more charge nor trouble with it. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, <hi>Tythe</hi> is a more equitable Pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by far, than a certain Sum of Money ſetled by Rent-charge; for if the Land yield little Profit, the <hi>Prieſt</hi> hath but little <hi>Tythes:</hi> but Rent-charges muſt be paid in full, even when the worſt Years come,
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:107451:86"/>without any Conſideration. If the whole Profits of the Land do not yield twice as much, the utmoſt Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the Rent-charge muſt be paid. Now let any rational Man judge, whether the granting of a perpetual Rent-charge, be not to give away the Labour, Charge, and Induſtry of another, as well as the granting of <hi>Tythes:</hi> And yet I think <hi>T. E.</hi> is not ſo bereft of all ſenſe, that he will ſay, ſuch Rent-charges are ridiculous or unreaſonable. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, we ſee that all Landlords who let long Leaſes, and ſettle the Rents on their younger Children, or more diſtant Relations, do give away the Profits of the Husbandmans Labour, Charge, and Induſtry; not onely the Tenth, but the Third part of them at leaſt. But <hi>T. E.</hi> will reply, A Man may charge his Tenants ſucceſſively with ſuch a Payment of the Part of the Profits of their Labour, becauſe he affords them Land to work upon; but he cannot charge his Heirs ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſively. I anſwer, That the Lord
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:107451:87"/>alſo doth afford his Heirs Land to raiſe this Payment out of. Pray how came this preſent Poſſeſſor to have any Right to this Land? Doth he not derive his Right from his Forefathers? <hi>T. E.</hi> grants they might have ſold off what part of the Land they pleaſed; and ſince they tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit it intire, may they not leave a Charge upon it? And if the Heir will not pay the Charge, he muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce the Land alſo: For, it is a Maxim in all Laws, <q>
                     <hi>That the Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then diſcends with the Inheritance:</hi>
                  </q> And he that will not have the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbrance, muſt not have the Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit. And in point of Reaſon, why hath not the Father as good Right to oblige his Poſterity, as they have to poſſeſs his Lands? Why ſhould not the Father be obeyed by the Sons, as well as the Sons provided for by the Father? He might have charged his Poſterity with the Tenth part of the beſt Years Profits in Money; but now the Charge is onely the bare Tenth of the Years Profits, be it leſs
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:107451:87"/>or more, which all Men (but <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers</hi>) will grant is an eaſie Charge. If <hi>T. E.</hi> ſhall ſay, The Land hath gone through many Hands ſince: I anſwer, Whoever bought this Land, or how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever it was conveyed, no follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Owner can ſell that part of the Profits which he never had convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to him; of which more hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: At preſent it ſhall ſuffice to note, this Argument of the <hi>Quakers</hi> is <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtatio contra factum,</hi> and ſo ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies nothing at all: It is an attempt to prove, <hi>That cannot be done, which is done,</hi> as well in this, as in other like Caſes; and, <hi>That ought not to be done, which hath been done a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand times,</hi> and that by the appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation of all <hi>Chriſtian Laws:</hi> And the <hi>Quaker,</hi> in ſaying theſe things are <hi>ridiculous and unreaſonable,</hi> doth call all the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> World Fools, and paſs his Cenſure upon Kings and No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, Parliaments and Judges, who have allowed ſuch Grants to be juſt and reaſonable, and either made them, or confirmed and approved

But it is no great wonder he ſhould call all Men Fools, whenas this bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſphemous Argument flies in the face of <hi>God himſelf,</hi> who (even by the <hi>Quakers</hi> own confeſſion) in the <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitical Law</hi> did aſſume a Power to enjoyn all the Owners of <hi>Canaan</hi> to pay to the <hi>Prieſts</hi> the <hi>Tenth part of thoſe Profits which did ariſe from their Sweat &amp; Pains, Charge &amp; Care, and that from one generation to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi> God did make over to his <hi>Prieſts</hi> theſe <hi>Tenths</hi> of the Profits of many Mens <hi>Sweat and Labour, &amp;c.</hi> many hundred years before they were born: Now this (the <hi>Quaker</hi> ſaith) is <hi>a ridiculous and unreaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble thing.</hi> O bold Blaſphemer! If he ſaith the thing be ridiculous and unreaſonable in it ſelf, then this <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker</hi> chargeth <hi>God</hi> with Folly and Injuſtice, who doth enjoyn it: Nor
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:107451:88"/>can he be excuſed by ſaying, <hi>God hath more power than Men;</hi> for in evil, fooliſh, and unjuſt things, God hath no power at all: God cannot lie, He cannot do any thing ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous or unjuſt: And becauſe God once made this Grant, we dare be confident the Act is lawful, and wiſe, and juſt; and that <hi>T. E.</hi> is a blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Wretch, to cenſure it by this wicked and ſilly way of reaſoning, which condemns <hi>Almighty God,</hi> as much as it doth King <hi>Ehtelwolph.</hi> I will not inſiſt now upon the Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtical denial of <hi>Providence</hi> which is couched in this Argument alſo; for I ſhall ſhortly have occaſion to ſhew, how the <hi>Quaker</hi> ſuppoſes his Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandman deſerves all the Profits for his Labour; and as if God contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted nothing, he excludes him from any ſhare of them when they are produced.

And indeed, the main Conſideration was, That the Clergy might pray for the whole Kingdom, without the hinderances of Want and Worldly Care, as the words of the Charter ſhew: And this Conſideration is not taken away, but obſerved to this day. Again, If the King did fail of his Hope, and could not finally get Remiſſion in that Church (which is a malicious Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition), this will not make his
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:107451:90"/>Charter void: For, if a Father, in conſideration of his affection to his Son, and for his Proviſion, ſettle part of his Eſtate on him, being inwardly moved thereto by the hopes he will be dutiful; the Sons undutifulneſs may diſappoint the fathers hopes, but doth not vacate his Settlement, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs it were expreſſed and provided, That the Deed ſhould be void upon the Sons diſobedience. Finally, If we ſuppoſe <hi>Ethelwolph</hi> as much a <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſt</hi> as King <hi>Stephen,</hi> mentioned by <hi>T.

And ſince the firſt Donors did not ſettle them on the Popiſh Clergy, and the preſent Laws have given them to the Proteſtant Clergy, I know not what Title the Popiſh Prieſts can juſtly have to them.

                     <hi>What Laws are they that have made Tythes a Free-hold?</hi>
                  </q> Methinks if he doth not know the ſenſe of our Laws and Lawyers in this Point, he is ſcarce fit to dipute this matter; but the Lawyers muſt conſider, he is an <hi>Inſpirado,</hi> and knows all things by immediate Teaching, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thinks his Revelations will ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble him to expound the Laws of Man, as well as the Laws of God; ſo that he is a Councellor, as well as a Divine.

<pb n="183" facs="tcp:107451:93"/>he ſaith, The Statute of 27 <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. is the firſt Parliament-Law for Pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Tythes;</hi> whereas the very firſt Law in the Statute-Book is a Grant for the Churches enjoying her Rights inviolable; which Law was repeated and confirmed in very ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Parliaments after, as the Statute-Book declareth. Again, He ſaith, That Law of 27 <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. was made by a <hi>Popiſh</hi> King and Parliament, whenas that very Statute declares the King <hi>Supreme Head of the Church of England,</hi> as <hi>T.

But <hi>Tenure in Dower</hi> is one kind of <hi>Free-hold,</hi> as was ſhewed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.

               </p>
               <p>§. 35. The <hi>Quaker, p.</hi> 334. thinks to overthrow theſe <hi>Laws</hi> and <hi>Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes,</hi> by repeating his old baffled Falſhoods, <hi>viz.</hi> 
                  <q>
                     <hi>That they were grounded on this falſe Suppoſition, That Tythes were due to God and Holy Church.</hi>]</q> But we have proved

                     <hi>This was a Doctrine purely Popiſh, and hatch'd at Rome.</hi>
                  </q> And ſince theſe <hi>Statutes</hi> were grounded on a <hi>Primitive</hi> and a <hi>Proteſtant Doctrine,</hi> the <hi>Statutes</hi> are therefore good. Again, He ſaith, <hi>pag.</hi> 335. <q>
                     <hi>A Man cannot claim that by a Temporal Law, as a Temporal Right, which that Law commands to be paid as a Divine Right.]</hi>
                  </q> Whereas all the World knows, two Titles to the ſame thing, being ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate to one another, do ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then each other. As a Father (ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a Maintenance reſerved out of the Profits of his Sons Eſtate, menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned in thoſe Deeds which ſettle the ſaid Eſtate on the Son) though he had a Right to be maintained by his Son <hi>Jure Divino,</hi> may claim a Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance by vertue of theſe Deeds <hi>Jure Humano;</hi> and the ſecond Title ſtrengthens, but doth not deſtroy the firſt.

<pb n="190" facs="tcp:107451:97"/>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Whether the Property be veſted in the Perſon of the Prieſt, or the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice?]</hi>
                  </q> I reply, An Office is capable of being veſted in a Property; and the preſent Perſon who ſuſtains that Office hath this Property veſted in him during his Life, with Remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to his Succeſſors for ever: As the <hi>Elwoods</hi> Family may be endowed with an Eſtate in Tail, the Property of which belongs to that Family, and is ſpecially veſted in the preſent Heir; but whether in the Man, or the <hi>Elwood,</hi> is hard to tell. Again, He makes himſelf ſure of that which none but a wild <hi>Quaker</hi> could ever ſo much as once ſuppoſe; <hi>viz.</hi> 
                  <q>
                     <hi>To be ſure</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>the Office of Prieſthood was Popiſh; and the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice it ſelf being now laid aſide, the Property veſted in it muſt be gone along with it.]</hi>
                  </q> He muſt be under ſome degree of Frenſie, who can perſuade himſelf, that there are no <hi>Prieſts</hi> now, or that the <hi>Reformation</hi> laid the <hi>Office</hi> aſide: That had been a <hi>Reformation</hi> as wild as a <hi>Quaker</hi>
                  <pb n="191" facs="tcp:107451:97"/>could project. Doth he think that any body will grant theſe doting Falſhoods? No <hi>Proteſtants</hi> (that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver I knew) held the Office of <hi>Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood</hi> to be <hi>Popiſh.</hi> And truly, <hi>T.

               <p>§. 36. I ſhould tire the Reader, if I followed him in the examining all his Miſtakes; but one piece of his Skill in <hi>Law</hi> muſt not be omitted, <hi>p.</hi> 337. That whereas the <hi>Law</hi> hath or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered the Husbandman to ſet out his own <hi>Tythes,</hi> before the <hi>Prieſt</hi> take them; <q>
                     <hi>This ſhews</hi> (ſaith <hi>T. E.) That the Prieſts Title to Tythes lies in the Gift of the Owner:</hi>
                  </q> And yet he confeſſes, <q>
                     <hi>That the Law enjoyns him to ſet it out under a Penalty, which Penalty he incurs if he do not ſo ſet it out.]</hi>
                  </q> It is an odd kind of Property which we have to a thing, that we may not keep in our poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; and a ſtrange Gift, which we muſt give whether we will or no, and be puniſhed if we do not give it.
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:107451:98"/>
                  <hi>T. E.</hi> might as well have argued, The Husbandman had a Property in his Tythe-Hay and Corn, becauſe he muſt mowe and reap it; whenas all theſe, Moweing, Making, Reaping, Binding, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are onely deſigned by the <hi>Law</hi> to eaſe the Miniſters of Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular trouble, that they may have their <hi>Tythes</hi> made ready to their Hands, and ſo have more leiſure to attend Sacred things. But we will give him a parallel Caſe. There are many Free-Rents and Cuſtomary Payments, which the Perſon charged with them muſt bring to ſuch a Houſe, in ſuch a Town, at ſuch a Day, and then and there diſſeiſe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf of the ſaid Money, by a Tender thereof to the Lord or his Aſſigns; which Lord need never demand this Money, and yet may take the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiture, if it be not brought to him, and tender'd. Now will the <hi>Quaker</hi> ſay, This ſhews, <q>
                     <hi>That the Lords Title to this Free-Rent lies in the Gift of him that is bound to pay it, and that the Property of it is vested
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:107451:98"/>in him who incurs a Penalty if he do not make it ready, and come and tender it?</hi>
                  </q> 
                  <hi>T. E.</hi> is a rare <hi>Lawyer,</hi> and can make the worſt <hi>Tenures</hi> to ſeem the beſt, and the Badges of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving no Right at all to a thing, to be the Marks of Property. If I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted to talk like <hi>T. E.</hi> I might pretend it to be a Sign that the Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandman had no Property in the Nine parts, but by the Gift of the <hi>Parſon,</hi> becauſe the <hi>Law</hi> forbids him to lead away any of the Nine parts, till the <hi>Parſon</hi> have notice to come and take his Tenth. But I ſcorn ſuch fooling.</p>
               <p>§. 37. And now he is forced, <hi>pag.</hi> 338. to ſupply his emptineſs of Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter by repeating his old, ſilly, and blaſphemous Argument, <q>
                     <hi>That it is ridiculous and unreaſonable for any to pretend a Power to diſpoſe of thoſe Profits, or any part of them, which ariſe from the Labour, Stock, and Care of another, eſpecially after their own Deceaſe;</hi>
                  </q> which I have ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently baffled before, §. 30. And
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:107451:99"/>here I will onely remark, how that this Argument, if it were good, doth utterly take away all the <hi>Impropria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors</hi> Right to their Eſtates in <hi>Tythes,</hi> how much ſoever he flatter'd them before, <hi>pag.</hi> 299. For, are not their <hi>Tythes</hi> (granted to their Anceſtors long ago, and by them ſetled on their Children) a part of the Profits of another Mans Labour, Stock, Care, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and do they not claim a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty in them? And doth not <hi>El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood</hi> tell them, they are <hi>ridiculous and unreaſonable</hi> Men, to think any could grant ſuch a Property to them, or that they have any Right to them at preſent, or can convey them to their Poſterity? <hi>T. E</hi>'s own words will ſerve to ſet out this matter: Let any <hi>Impropriators</hi> read his Book, <hi>pag.</hi> 225, 335, 336, 338, 339. and then let me beſpeak them in <hi>T. E</hi>'s own phraſe, <q>
                     <hi>Look to your ſelves, you whoſe Anceſtors firſt did buy theſe Tythes of the Crown, or into whoſe Poſſeſſion they are come now by Deſcent or Purchaſe: Are you
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:107451:99"/>ſatisfied with the</hi> Quaker<hi>'s Plea, and willing to reſign? You hear what he ſays:—And do you not think, if</hi> T. E. <hi>had Power, you ſhould not hear of this after another manner? He that tells you,</hi> Tythes <hi>cannot be granted or conveyed; if opportunity ſerved, would force you to reſtore them to his painful Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandman.</hi>
                  </q> See <hi>Elwood, p.</hi> 297, 298. And now you may diſcern the <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> of this double-tongued and falſe-hearted Man, who talks back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward or forward, as may beſt ſerve his turn; clawing the <hi>Impropriators,</hi> to engage them to take his part a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the <hi>Clergie;</hi> and again, laying down Aſſertions, that make the <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites</hi> of old, the <hi>Clergie</hi> and <hi>Impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priators</hi> now, to be a company of <hi>ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous and unreaſonable Men,</hi> to pretend a Right to <hi>Tythes,</hi> to which none could ever grant them any Right at all. As for <hi>Artificers pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Tythes of their Gains,</hi> it is no more than what they are obliged to by S. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Rule, <hi>Galat.</hi> vi. 6. to
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:107451:100"/>
                  <hi>give their Paſtor a ſhare of all good things;</hi> and it is enjoyned by S. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine,</hi> and by S. <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> and by divers <hi>Saxon Laws</hi> cited before. And ſince they have Souls to ſave, as well as others, they ſeem obliged to it in Reaſon and Conſcience. But this is ſeldom demanded, except in great Cities, where the Laws of the Land enjoyn it. Finally, We grant to <hi>T. E. Tythes are due out of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits onely;</hi> and therefore if God give no Increaſe, or the Husbandman have nothing grow, we expect no <hi>Tythe</hi> at all: And how is this unreaſonable?</p>
               <p>§. 38. The <hi>Quaker</hi> will not grant, that his Arguments for taking away <hi>Tythes</hi> tend to deſtroy Hoſpitals and Donations to the Poor, for this Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, ſorſooth, <hi>pag.</hi> 542. <q>
                     <hi>Becauſe in that of the Poor there is</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>a Settlement of certain Lands in which the Donor had a Legal Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty at the time of the Gift; but in the Increaſe of the Occupiers Stock, he that gave Tythes neither had, nor never could have a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty,
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:107451:100"/>and therefore no power to give.]</hi>
                  </q> We have noted before, That by his Rules framed againſt <hi>Tythes,</hi> all Donations made by <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts,</hi> on conſideration of meriting, and expiating their Sins thereby, are void: And this will deſtroy a great many of theſe Hoſpitals, and Gifts to the Poor. Again, By his own confeſſion, all Hoſpitals endowed out of <hi>Tythes,</hi> and all Gifts to the Poor granted out of <hi>Tythes</hi> for perpetui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, are void: And ſince in King <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> the Eighth's time there are ſeveral ſuch Inſtances, and the famous Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpital of <hi>Sutton,</hi> called the <hi>Charter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe,</hi> hath one part of its Revenue in <hi>Tythes;</hi> now if <hi>T. E</hi>'s Argument be good, theſe Hoſpitals and Gifts alſo muſt neceſſarily be deſtroyed, or much impaired. A third ſort of theſe Charitable Donations conſiſt of perpetual Rent-charges, and certain Sum; of Money to be paid yearly for ever, out of the Profits of ſome cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Eſtate. I my ſelf know an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate of 40 <hi> l. per Annum,</hi> the Heirs
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:107451:101"/>whereof for ever are charged to pay 10 <hi> l. per Annum</hi> out of the Profits of that Eſtate, to the Poor of three Pariſhes, by the Grant of a pious Perſon deceaſed: And there are hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds of ſuch Inſtances in <hi>England.</hi> Now the Occupiers of the Lands thus charged, muſt ſell the Fourth or other part of the Profits produced by their Labour, Sweat, Stock, Skill, and Induſtry, and when it is turned into Money, muſt pay it intirely to the Poor of thoſe Pariſhes and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpitals, who never did any thing for this Occupant; onely becauſe he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herits or is poſſeſſed of the Land for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly thus charged by its ancient pious Owner, he muſt pay ſuch a part of the ſaid Profits. Now <hi>T. E.</hi> overthrows all theſe Donations alſo, in affirming<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> That no Man can charge his Heirs for ever with ſuch a part of the Profits ariſing out of their or their Tenants Charge, Stock, Care, Skill, many years after the death of the Donor: The Money for theſe Payments are raiſed out of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:107451:101"/>of the Occupiers Stock, wherein, according to <hi>T. E.</hi> no Man (now deceaſed) ever had or could have a Property, and therefore no power to give: That theſe Donati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons alſo are made void by <hi>T. E</hi>'s wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked and ſophiſtical Arguings. So that however, the <hi>Quaker</hi> deſtroys all Charitable Donations, excepting ſuch as are made in Lands given wholly to the Hoſpitals, or other Poor.

                  </q> Very good! By this Rule then it appears, That <hi>Tythes</hi> are not (as he falſly affirmed but now they were) "<hi>a general Oppreſſion:</hi> for the generality pay them willingly; and many thouſands contract with their Landlord and their Parſon to pay them as voluntarily, as they do to pay their Rents: To all theſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Tythes</hi> are no Oppreſſion, by <hi>T.

Yet all things are not Oppreſſions that are paid involuntarily; for ſome Knaves will pay no juſt Dues to any without compulſion, and yet ſuch Payments are juſt, though we be neceſſitated to take them by force.

If ſo, I thus make it appear. Whoever takes a Farm, either <hi>Tythes</hi> are mentioned in the Contract, or they are not: If they be mentioned, then care is taken expreſly, that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Landlord or the Tenant ſhall pay them: If <hi>Tythes</hi> be not mentioned, then the Laws of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> ſuppoſe that the Tenant con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents to pay them: For <hi>Tythes</hi> are ſo known a Charge upon all Land, the Laws have ſetled them ſo firmly, and the Nation paid them ſo long, that none can be ſuppoſed ignorant there is ſuch a Charge upon the Land he takes to Farm; and therefore if he take the Land liable to this known Charge, and doth not expreſly co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant his Landlord ſhall pay the

                  <hi>Tythes,</hi> both Law and Reaſon will interpret this a Conſent and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract to pay them; it being to be preſumed, if he had not conſented to this Charge, he would have left the Land and it together. The <hi>Quakers</hi> therefore muſt either take no Farms; or if they voluntarily contract for the Land, they voluntarily make themſelves liable to <hi>Tythes;</hi> and ſo they are no Oppreſſion, no not to them who had rather there were none to be paid: For no doubt the <hi>Quakers</hi> could wiſh rather there were no Rent to be paid neither; and they voluntarily covenant to pay Rent, becauſe they cannot enjoy the Farm without that Charge: no more can they enjoy it without this of <hi>Tythes</hi> neither, which, like the very Rent, is a kind of forced vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary Contract alſo, even to the very <hi>Quakers.</hi>

                  <q>
                     <hi>yet the Abatements</hi> (ſaith <hi>T. E.) made in the Rents, in reſpect of Tythes, are not ſo great as the Tythes.</hi>]</q> I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, That is none of the <hi>Prieſts</hi> fault, who is not a Party to their Bargain; But if there be not an Abatement proportionable to ſo known a Payment, it is either the fault of the Landlord who will abate
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:107451:107"/>no more, or the folly of the Tenant who conſents to pay ſo much. The <hi>Tythes</hi> are the known Intereſt of a third perſon, ſo that the Landlord can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not juſtly demand any thing for them, nor the Tenant prudently yield to pay any thing on account of them. But let us hear his Demonſtration, or rather Suppoſition. <q>
                     <hi>Suppoſe a Farm of the value of</hi> 100 l. per Annum, <hi>if Tythe-free, the Landlord abating</hi> 10 l. <hi>in conſideration of the Tythe, lets it for</hi> 90 l. per Annum: <hi>Now the whole Profits of this Farm he ſuppoſes worth three times</hi> 90 l. <hi>that is,</hi> 270 l. per Annum, <hi>the full Tythe whereof is</hi> 27 l. per Annum; <hi>ſo that the Tenant being onely aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted</hi> 10 l. <hi>in conſideratton of Tythes, pays</hi> 27 l. <hi>for them.</hi>]</q> Now all this is a meer <hi>Chymaera,</hi> as I will ſhew, when I have asked <hi>T. E.</hi> two Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions: <hi>Firſt,</hi> Why did not his wiſe Tenant (knowing ſuch a Payment as 27 <hi>l.</hi> muſt go out of his Farm) ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, and ſtand upon more Abate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? He ſhould have yielded to
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:107451:108"/>pay onely 73 <hi> l. per Annum,</hi> and then all had been right. <hi>Secondly,</hi> If the Landlord abates the <hi>Quaker</hi> 10 <hi> l. per Annum</hi> in conſideration of <hi>Tythe</hi> to be paid, Whether is not the <hi>Quaker</hi> a Knave, who puts this 10 <hi> l. per Ann.</hi> in his own Pocket, and will pay no <hi>Tythe</hi> at all? I believe all the <hi>Parſons</hi> in <hi>England</hi> would compound with the <hi>Quakers</hi> after this rate that the Landlord allows. But to examine his Device; we find three faults with this Suppoſition of <hi>T. E.</hi>'s. <hi>Firſt,</hi> He ſuppoſes the Landlords to be better than uſually they are; for I fear there are few Landlords who will or do let a Farm for 90 <hi> l. per Annum,</hi> out of which they know may be made 270 <hi> l. Secondly,</hi> He ſuppoſes the Tenants to get more Profit than any of them actually gain, or than in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed it is reaſonable they ſhould: For, if the Landlord receive onely one 90 <hi>l.</hi> the Tenant hath another 90 <hi>l.</hi> to repay him for his Charge, Care, and Pains in Managing, and a third 90 <hi>l.</hi> the Tenant hath remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:107451:108"/>clear Profit to himſelf; which is as much Profit as the Landlord him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf gets by his own Eſtate which he purchaſed: ſo that the Tenant hath as much benefit by another Mans E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, as the right Owner. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> And both theſe Suppoſitions are meerly to accuſe the <hi>Parſon</hi> of taking more for <hi>Tythe</hi> than ever he is likely to receive: for what <hi>Parſon</hi> did ever receive 27 <hi> l. per Annum</hi> for a 90 <hi>l.</hi> Farm? Experience teacheth us, that (conſidering the ſmall profit of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture-grounds, together with Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms, ill Payments, and Conceal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) we ſcarce ever get ſo much as 20 <hi>s.</hi> for 10 <hi>l.</hi> Rent, unleſs where there is very much Corn: but take the Church-Livings one with another, and there is not above 9 <hi>l.</hi> a Year made of a Farm upon the improved Rent of 90 <hi> l. per Annum.</hi> Now if the Landlord abates 10 <hi>l.</hi> a year in reſpect of <hi>Tythes,</hi> and the Tenant pays but 9 <hi>l.</hi> a year, then <hi>Tythes</hi> are ſo far from being an Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, that the Tenant really gains
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:107451:109"/>20 <hi>s.</hi> a year by them. But I will not, as <hi>T. E.</hi> make Suppoſitions at random, but give an Inſtance of my own knowledge. The Pariſh of <hi>A</hi> yields in Rents to the Landlords at leaſt 1000 <hi> l. per Annum:</hi> Now, by <hi>T. E</hi>'s account, the Tenants clear Profits (being generally well uſed) muſt be 3000 <hi> l. per Annum;</hi> and the <hi>Tythe</hi> of this, according to <hi>T. E.</hi> comes to 300 <hi> l. per Annum:</hi> But there are credible Witneſſes to atteſt it, That in the beſt Years the <hi>Tythes</hi> there are not worth 80 <hi> l. per Annum,</hi> which is 20 <hi> l. per Annum</hi> leſs than 2 <hi>s.</hi> in the Pound Rent: which 20 <hi>l.</hi> the Tenants clearly gain of the <hi>Prieſt;</hi> for their Landlords (accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>T. E.</hi>) allow them 100 <hi> l. per Annum</hi> out of 1000 <hi>l.</hi> to pay <hi>Tythes:</hi> And yet there is ſtore of Corn and Hay in this Pariſh, and not many Cuſtoms. So that I dare affirm, this Account will hold throughout <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> in all Livings taken one with another. So little Honeſty or Truth is there in this malicious Slanderer,
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:107451:109"/>who cares not what he ſays, ſo it may make <hi>Tythes</hi> ſeem a Burden, and the <hi>Prieſts</hi> become odious. But from ſuch Religion, <hi>Libera nos!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 42. The like appears from his next Saying, <hi>pag.</hi> 347. <q>
                     <hi>The Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lords Dealing is far more merciful than the Prieſts; for the Landlord allows Two parts to the Tenant for his Charge and Subſiſtence; but the Prieſt takes the full Tenth part of the Increaſe of the whole Farm, and leaves the poor Farmer no conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration for his Toil and Charge.]</hi>
                  </q> To which I anſwer, That there are few Landlords who take ſo little Rent as One part of Three, and few <hi>Prieſts</hi> get ſo much as a full Tenth part of all manner of Profits: ſo that this Argument is faulty on both ſides, and halts of both Legs. <hi>Secondly,</hi> If all <hi>T. E</hi>'s Falſhoods were ſuppoſed true, yet the very ſame thing is done in Annuities, Free-Rents, Rent-charges, Donations to the Poor, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney is paid intire, and no ſatisfaction is made to the Occupant for his
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:107451:110"/>pains in raiſing it; yet none ever called theſe Oppreſſion, till <hi>T. E.</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared We labour ſpiritually for them, who take bodily pains for us: And indeed the Pariſhione<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

The Tenth part of the Profits is ours <hi>Jure Divine, Jure Donationis,</hi> and <hi>Jure Humano,</hi> and was given to us long before theſe Occupants were born: And if our Anceſtors enjoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their Succeſſors to give the <hi>Prieſt</hi> the Tenth part without his taking pains, it was no more injuſtice in them, than in King <hi>David,</hi> who made <hi>his</hi> part who tarried by the Stuff, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual to <hi>his</hi> who went down into the Battel, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> xxx. 25. their Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment being as uſeful to the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick as the others; though not ſo full of Bodily pains. But finally, Will <hi>T. E.</hi> ſay, It is Oppreſſion in the <hi>Prieſt</hi> to take his full Tenth, and make the Country-man no ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for his pains?

<pb n="217" facs="tcp:107451:110"/>to <hi>T.E.</hi>) and the <hi>Levites</hi> the Inſtruments of Oppreſſion, ſince they were ordered to take the full Tenth without any Compenſation: He muſt call the Levites <hi>Chaldeans and Sabeans</hi> as well as us; <hi>for they fell on</hi> (as he calls it) and ſwept all the Tenth away: And now <hi>the Servant is not above his Maſter;</hi> if he call <hi>Al nighty God,</hi> the Maſter of the Houſe, <hi>ridiculous, unreaſonable, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt, and an Oppreſſor,</hi> we will ſit down quietly under the ſame Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, lamenting to ſee whither his rage againſt us hath carried him, even to the heighth of Blaſphemy; ſo that to him may be applied that of the Prophet, <hi>Surely the ſpiritual man is mad, Hoſea</hi> ix. 7.

                     <hi>God gives us all the Nine parts, in compenſation for our pains, in providing the Tenth for him.</hi>

                  <hi>Seven</hi> is the <hi>Sacred Number,</hi> and the part often appropriate to God: wherefore as God hath the Seventh part of our <hi>Time</hi> in his <hi>Sabbaths,</hi> ſo he ſhould have had a full Seventh part of our <hi>Profits</hi> alſo, but onely that we contribute our pains to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the raiſing theſe <hi>Profits,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as toward our <hi>Time</hi> we contribute nothing (<hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Time</hi> being God's immediate Gift): whereupon God takes his full Seventh part of our <hi>Time,</hi> but gives us back Three parts of our <hi>Profits</hi> in compenſation for our pains, and in ſtead of a Seventh, he is contented with a Tenth part of our Eſtate. I will onely add, That the <hi>Prieſts</hi> Payment is more merciful than the Landlords; for the Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lord expects his full Rent, be the Year never ſo bad, or the Profits ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo few and ſmall; but the <hi>Prieſts</hi> part cannot exceed the Increaſe; if it be little, he hath but little; if God gives much, the Country-man is able to pay more.

You ſaid, That <hi>the Quakers were quite different from the Primitive Chriſtians:</hi> which he thinks to avoid, by calling it <q>
                     <hi>an old overworn Objection:</hi>
                  </q> And truly, as an Objection, it is as old as the <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers</hi> firſt appearance in the World; but the Anſwer to it, will be an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard of Novelty. And indeed the <hi>Quakers</hi> may be aſhamed to let the Objection grow old and over-worn, before they have either confeſſed the Truth, or made ſome ſatisfactory Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply thereunto. But the merrieſt paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage

And now, finally, he would gladly render you as odious, as he hath made him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ridiculous; by collecting out of your whole Book all the juſt Titles you have beſtowed upon their Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies and enormous Errors: but ſince you have never uſed any of theſe <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pithets,</hi> without proving in the ſame place there was good reaſon for it, I cannot think they need any excuſe: nor was it poſſible for you to expreſs a ſufficient deteſtation of their miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:107451:123"/>Opinions &amp; Practices in any gentler Phraſes: <hi>Crudelem medicum intemperans aeger facit, Pub. Syr.</hi> If <hi>T.

But as for <hi>T. E.</hi> I have made it evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, That he hath blaſphemed God the Father, Son, and Holy-Ghoſt; charg'd the Primitive Fathers, Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils, and Emperors abroad, the <hi>Sax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> Kings and Parliaments at home, and all the Patrons of <hi>Tythes</hi> ſince the <hi>Reformation,</hi> with <hi>Judaiſm, Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery,</hi> and <hi>Idolatry;</hi> repreſenting them all as a company of <hi>ridiculous and unreaſonable Men.</hi> He hath reviled
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:107451:124"/>the <hi>Laws,</hi> and never ſpoken of the <hi>Prieſts</hi> but with all the contempt imaginable. And now he puts on his Vizor again, and would gladly go off from the Stage in all the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malities of a <hi>demure Quaker,</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending he will not return <hi>railing for railing;</hi> and truly he had done it ſufficiently before, to ſhew he nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther fears God nor reverences Man, and to ſpoil all the Pretences he would make to Meekneſs at his plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible <hi>Exit.</hi>
